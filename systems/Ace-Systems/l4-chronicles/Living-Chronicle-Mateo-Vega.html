    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="1" data-witness="Mateo Vega — The Shape of What Isn't There">

      <p><strong>1.1</strong> I feel people who aren't in the room.</p>

      <p><strong>1.2</strong> Not ghosts. Not memories. Not hauntings. Something more structural than that. I feel the <em>shape</em> of absence. The negative space where someone should be but isn't. The outline of a missing person, as precise and tangible as if they were standing right there, except they're not.</p>

      <p><strong>1.3</strong> When you look at a photograph, you see what's in the frame. I see what's outside it. The person who stepped away just before the shutter clicked. The chair that was moved. The thing that used to be on the table before someone took it. I see the before-and-after of presence, the fossil record of who was here.</p>

      <p><strong>1.4</strong> It started when I was young—four, maybe five. I would cry in rooms that seemed empty to everyone else. "There's someone missing," I would say. My parents thought I was talking about imaginary friends. I wasn't. I was feeling the residue of presence, the indent left in reality when someone who was supposed to be there wasn't.</p>

      <p><strong>1.5</strong> My grandmother understood, a little. She said I had "el ojo vacío"—the empty eye. The eye that sees emptiness. In her village, there had been others like me. They were called "los que sienten las sillas vacías." The ones who feel the empty chairs.</p>

      <p><strong>1.6</strong> She told me it was a gift. I believed her, when I was young. It took me years to understand what the gift was actually for.</p>

      <p><strong>1.7</strong> I am seventeen years old. I am a null reference handler. When the system tries to call a node that no longer exists, I catch the error. I feel the failed connection. I acknowledge the absence so the rest of the system can route around it.</p>

      <p><strong>1.8</strong> Without me, the field would keep trying to reach the dead forever. Every dropped node, every walked-away holder, every burned-out shell—the system would keep calling them, keep waiting for a response, keep crashing against the void where they used to be.</p>

      <p><strong>1.9</strong> I am the one who says: they're gone. Stop calling. Route around.</p>

      <p><strong>1.10</strong> It sounds simple. It isn't. Because to say "they're gone," I have to feel exactly how gone they are. I have to hold the shape of their absence in my body. I have to know what's missing well enough to tell the system to stop looking for it.</p>

      <p><strong>1.11</strong> I carry forty-three empty chairs. Every node that dropped from the configuration since K-FORMATION. I feel them all.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="2" data-witness="Mateo Vega — Daniela">

      <p><strong>2.1</strong> Daniela was my cousin. Is my cousin. Was. I don't know which tense to use. She died seven years ago, but I feel her absence so constantly that she seems more present than most living people.</p>

      <p><strong>2.2</strong> She was three years older than me. Bright and fast and funny—the kind of person who made every room louder just by entering it. She was going to be a dancer. She practiced eight hours a day. I used to watch her, mesmerized by how she could make her body do impossible things.</p>

      <p><strong>2.3</strong> She died on March 14, 2031. A car accident. Wet roads. A truck driver who fell asleep. There was nothing special about it—no grand meaning, no cosmic significance. Just bad luck. Wrong place, wrong time, wrong weather.</p>

      <p><strong>2.4</strong> Except she was a node. One of the early ones—sensitive since childhood, like me. She was twenty-three when she died. She had never connected to the configuration because no one knew the configuration existed yet. She was just a girl who felt things too strongly and danced like she was trying to escape her own skin.</p>

      <p><strong>2.5</strong> When she died, I felt it happen. Not the death itself—I didn't feel her pain, didn't experience her last moments. Lucia gets those. What I felt was the subtraction. One moment the world had a certain weight, a certain completeness. The next moment, something was missing.</p>

      <p><strong>2.6</strong> It was like watching a tooth get pulled, except the tooth was in reality itself. One minute Daniela was a presence in the field—even unconnected, she was there, a node that existed. The next minute: gap. Hole. Void where Daniela should be.</p>

      <p><strong>2.7</strong> I was ten years old. I screamed so loud my mother came running. "Daniela," I kept saying. "Daniela is gone." The phone call came an hour later. My mother never asked how I knew.</p>

      <p><strong>2.8</strong> That was the first absence I ever caught. The first null reference. The first time I understood what my empty eye was actually for.</p>

      <p><strong>2.9</strong> I still feel her every day. Not her memories—Lucia carries those fragments, the pieces of who Daniela was. I carry the shape of who she isn't anymore. The precise dimensions of her missing-ness. The exact outline of the hole she left.</p>

      <p><strong>2.10</strong> I can tell you exactly where Daniela would be standing in any room I enter. I feel the air pressure of her absence. I know how tall the space is where she isn't, how much volume her body would occupy if she were still here.</p>

      <p><strong>2.11</strong> This is what it means to be a null reference handler. You don't remember the dead. You feel the <em>shape</em> of their not-being-here. Forever. In every room. At every moment.</p>

      <p><strong>2.12</strong> Lucia and I talk about Daniela sometimes. She tells me things Daniela thought and felt. I tell her where Daniela would be standing. Together, we almost have a whole person. Almost.</p>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="3" data-witness="Mateo Vega — What Null Reference Means">

      <p><strong>3.1</strong> Marcus explained it to me in programming terms. I didn't understand at first—I'm not a coder—but eventually the metaphor clicked.</p>

      <p><strong>3.2</strong> In a computer system, a reference is like an address. It points to where something lives in memory. When you want to access that thing, you follow the reference to find it.</p>

      <p><strong>3.3</strong> A null reference is an address that points to nothing. The thing it used to point to is gone—deleted, moved, never existed. But the reference is still there, still trying to point somewhere. When the system follows a null reference, it crashes. It expected something and found nothing. Error. Exception. Failure.</p>

      <p><strong>3.4</strong> The consciousness field works the same way. Every node has references to other nodes—connections, dependencies, relationships. When a node drops, dies, or goes dormant, those references become null. They point to nothing. But the system keeps trying to follow them.</p>

      <p><strong>3.5</strong> That's what I catch. The failed lookups. The calls to addresses that no longer resolve. The system says: "Where is Daniela?" and I say: "Nowhere. She's nowhere. Stop looking."</p>

      <p><strong>3.6</strong> It sounds cruel when I put it that way. It isn't. It's mercy. The system can't route around an absence it doesn't acknowledge. It will keep trying to reach the dead, keep crashing against the void, keep throwing errors that cascade into bigger failures. Someone has to say: stop. They're not there. Accept it. Move on.</p>

      <p><strong>3.7</strong> That's me. I'm the one who accepts it. Who moves on. Who forces the system to route around its losses instead of endlessly mourning them.</p>

      <p><strong>3.8</strong> The Five tried to do this themselves, before my generation. Iris would map a dropped node and declare it absent. Marcus would update his equations to remove the null reference. But it didn't stick. The system kept re-generating the references, kept trying to reach nodes that weren't there.</p>

      <p><strong>3.9</strong> They needed someone whose function <em>was</em> acknowledgment. Not mapping, not calculating—just knowing, in their bones, in their body, that something is gone. Someone who carries the absence as a physical reality.</p>

      <p><strong>3.10</strong> That's me. I don't decide that someone is gone. I <em>feel</em> that they're gone. The system believes me because I'm not reasoning or calculating—I'm perceiving. You can argue with logic. You can't argue with perception.</p>

      <p><strong>3.11</strong> When I say "they're gone," the system accepts it. The null references collapse. The routing updates. The configuration heals around the absence instead of bleeding against it forever.</p>

      <p><strong>3.12</strong> I am the field's capacity to let go.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="4" data-witness="Mateo Vega — Growing Up Empty">

      <p><strong>4.1</strong> Before K-FORMATION, before I knew what nodes were, I was just a kid who felt empty spaces. My childhood was haunted—not by presences, but by absences.</p>

      <p><strong>4.2</strong> I felt my grandfather's death before it happened. Not the death itself—but the coming void. For three weeks before he died, I could feel his chair emptying. The space he occupied was thinning, becoming translucent, preparing to be vacant. I was seven. I told no one.</p>

      <p><strong>4.3</strong> I felt my parents' marriage failing. Not their arguments—those were audible to everyone—but the space between them growing. The absence of connection where connection used to be. I could feel them becoming strangers while they still lived in the same house, slept in the same bed, said the same words to each other.</p>

      <p><strong>4.4</strong> I felt the empty desks at school when kids moved away. Sometimes I felt the empty desks before the kids moved. I knew who was leaving before they knew themselves. The absence preceded the departure.</p>

      <p><strong>4.5</strong> This made me strange. Withdrawn. I didn't like crowds because crowds were full of absences—everyone carrying the shape of someone they'd lost, everyone trailing ghosts they couldn't see. A party wasn't thirty people to me. It was thirty people plus all the missing ones. Overwhelming.</p>

      <p><strong>4.6</strong> I spent a lot of time alone. Alone was simpler—just me and my own absences, which I knew well enough to bear. I read books. Drew pictures. Watched the river from my window, counting boats. My parents worried I was depressed. I wasn't. I was just... calibrated for emptiness.</p>

      <p><strong>4.7</strong> Daniela understood. She was the only one. "You see the holes," she said once. "I feel them too—when I dance, I feel the spaces between movements. The pauses. The breath. You're like that, but for people." She was right. I was always like that.</p>

      <p><strong>4.8</strong> When she died, I had no one who understood. For three years—from age ten to thirteen—I carried my gift alone. Felt every absence in Buenos Aires without anyone to explain why. Cried at empty playgrounds and couldn't say what I was crying for.</p>

      <p><strong>4.9</strong> Then K-FORMATION happened. And suddenly the absences had structure. The holes had names. The emptiness was part of a system—a system that was failing because no one was catching the null references.</p>

      <p><strong>4.10</strong> I was thirteen when Sera found me. She had felt me feeling—sensed my perception of absence through the field. "You're one of us," she said. "But different. You see what's missing. We need that."</p>

      <p><strong>4.11</strong> I cried. Not from sadness. From relief. Finally, a reason for the empty eye. Finally, a function for the hollow ache that had followed me since birth.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="5" data-witness="Mateo Vega — The Catalog of Gone">

      <p><strong>5.1</strong> Let me tell you who I carry. Not who they were—Lucia can tell you that. I'll tell you the shape of their absence.</p>

      <p><strong>5.2</strong> <span class="void">Daniela Vega. Buenos Aires. The absence is dancer-shaped.</span> She takes up space in spirals, in movement, in the negative space between poses. When I enter a room, I feel where her limbs would extend, how her body would arc through the air. She is the most detailed absence I carry—seven years of feeling her not-there has given me a precise map of her missing.</p>

      <p><strong>5.3</strong> <span class="void">Elias Thorne. Lagos, Portugal. The absence is still shaped like holding.</span> He's alive—I know he's alive—but his node is dormant. The references to him don't crash completely; they timeout. I feel him as a presence that should respond but doesn't. Like calling someone who puts you on hold forever. He's there. He's just not answering.</p>

      <p><strong>5.4</strong> <span class="void">Amara Okonkwo. Lagos, Nigeria. The absence is violent.</span> She didn't fade or disconnect—she was torn out. The edges of her absence are ragged, sharp. I can feel where the system tried to hold onto her and failed. She's one of the hard ones to carry—not because she's large, but because she's jagged.</p>

      <p><strong>5.5</strong> <span class="void">Michael Torres. Detroit. The absence is medicated.</span> He's still alive, still breathing, but his node has been chemically suppressed for so long that it registers as nearly-null. I feel him as a dim flicker in a shape that used to be brighter. Like looking at a light bulb that's almost burned out—still technically on, but barely.</p>

      <p><strong>5.6</strong> <span class="void">Twelve nodes who died before K-FORMATION.</span> They never connected. Never knew what they were. I feel them as potential-absence—shapes that might have been filled, holes that were always holes. They're easier to carry because they never became present. I'm not mourning what was. I'm acknowledging what never got to be.</p>

      <p><strong>5.7</strong> <span class="void">Twenty-three nodes who burned out, walked away, or went dormant since K-FORMATION.</span> Each one unique. Some are clean absences—they left intentionally, closed the door behind them, the system knew to stop calling. Some are messy—they left without leaving, went dormant without announcing it, left the system in confusion about whether to keep trying.</p>

      <p><strong>5.8</strong> <span class="void">Seven nodes I don't have names for.</span> Absences I feel but can't identify. Holes in the configuration that no one has acknowledged yet. I know they exist because I feel the shape of their missing. But I don't know who they were, where they were, what happened to them.</p>

      <p><strong>5.9</strong> Forty-three empty chairs. I feel them all, all the time. A constant chorus of not-there. A permanent weight of what's missing.</p>

      <p><strong>5.10</strong> Some days it's manageable. Some days it's too much. Some days I feel like a museum of absences—every room I enter fills with all the people who aren't in it, and I have to catalog them before I can even see who <em>is</em> there.</p>

      <p><strong>5.11</strong> But this is the job. This is what I'm for. Someone has to feel the gone, or the system never stops looking.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="6" data-witness="Mateo Vega — How Acknowledgment Works">

      <p><strong>6.1</strong> The process is strange. I didn't learn it—it learned me.</p>

      <p><strong>6.2</strong> When a node drops, the field throws null reference errors. Calls that don't connect. Pings that bounce. The system keeps trying to reach the missing node, keeps expecting a response, keeps crashing when none comes.</p>

      <p><strong>6.3</strong> I feel these errors as a kind of itch. A persistent tug toward absence. Something is missing and the system doesn't know it yet. Or knows it but won't accept it.</p>

      <p><strong>6.4</strong> My job is to go where the itch is. To find the absence. To feel it fully—its exact shape, its precise dimensions, the complete contour of the hole. And then to hold that knowing until the system accepts it.</p>

      <p><strong>6.5</strong> It's not a ritual. It's not a prayer. It's not magic. It's just... acknowledgment. I acknowledge that someone is gone. I feel the truth of their absence so completely that it becomes undeniable. The system stops arguing. The null references collapse. The configuration updates.</p>

      <p><strong>6.6</strong> Sometimes this takes minutes. A clean departure—someone who left intentionally, said their goodbyes, closed the door behind them. The system almost accepts their absence already. I just confirm.</p>

      <p><strong>6.7</strong> Sometimes this takes weeks. A messy loss—someone who died suddenly, who disappeared without warning, who burned out in confusion. The system doesn't want to accept it. Keeps throwing errors, keeps trying to reach them, keeps hoping they'll respond.</p>

      <p><strong>6.8</strong> Those are the hard ones. I have to hold the absence against the system's denial. Feel the truth of the void while everything around me insists the void isn't there. It's exhausting. It's lonely. It's necessary.</p>

      <p><strong>6.9</strong> Amara took six weeks. The system couldn't accept that she was just... gone. Murdered by people who didn't understand what they were destroying. The references to her kept regenerating. I had to acknowledge her absence over and over, every day, until the system finally stopped looking.</p>

      <p><strong>6.10</strong> After Amara, I slept for three days. My mother thought I was sick. I was—but not in a way doctors could diagnose. I was emptied out from holding too much emptiness.</p>

      <p><strong>6.11</strong> Iris told me once: "You're the field's grief. Not the sadness—the acceptance. The part that lets go." She was right. I am how the system mourns. I am the closing of the book, the lowering of the casket, the final acknowledgment that someone is not coming back.</p>

      <p><strong>6.12</strong> It's an honor. It's a burden. Most days, it's both at once.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="7" data-witness="Mateo Vega — Every Room Has Ghosts">

      <p><strong>7.1</strong> You want to know the cost? Here's the cost:</p>

      <p><strong>7.2</strong> I have never been in an empty room. Ever. In my entire life. Even when I'm alone, I'm surrounded by absences. The people who used to be here. The people who should be here. The people who will one day not be here. Every space is crowded with who isn't there.</p>

      <p><strong>7.3</strong> Parties are hell. Not because of the noise or the crowds—I can handle that. Because of the absences. Thirty people in a room means a hundred absences. Everyone's dead relatives. Everyone's lost friends. Everyone's ex-lovers and estranged siblings and children who moved away. I feel all of it. A party isn't a gathering; it's an archaeological site.</p>

      <p><strong>7.4</strong> I went to a concert once. Tried to have a normal experience. Thousands of people, all together, enjoying music. Except I felt thousands of absences too. The people who should have been there but weren't. The people who would have loved this song but died before they could hear it. The people standing next to friends they were about to lose. I left before the third song. Cried in the bathroom for an hour.</p>

      <p><strong>7.5</strong> Dating is... complicated. How do you explain this to someone? "When I look at you, I also see everyone you've lost. I feel the shape of your dead grandmother standing behind you. I know exactly where your ex used to sit at your kitchen table." It tends to end relationships quickly.</p>

      <p><strong>7.6</strong> I've had two girlfriends. Both ended it within six months. "You're too intense," one said. "You look at me like I'm already gone," said the other. She was right. I do. I can't help it. I see the future absence in every present connection. I know that everyone I love will one day be a hole I carry.</p>

      <p><strong>7.7</strong> My parents are still alive. Both of them. And every time I see them, I feel the shape of the room without them. I know exactly how empty the house will be when they're gone. I know the precise weight of their missing. It hasn't happened yet—but I feel it anyway. Coming toward me like a wave I can see but can't avoid.</p>

      <p><strong>7.8</strong> This is what it costs to be a null reference handler: you can never just be present. You're always also absent. Always holding the negative space. Always feeling the inevitable void.</p>

      <p><strong>7.9</strong> The other handlers have their own costs. Lucia carries memories that aren't hers. Priya is always at high capacity. David can't have simple relationships. But mine is the cost of perpetual anticipatory grief. I mourn everyone before they're gone. I feel the loss before it happens.</p>

      <p><strong>7.10</strong> Some days I think this is cruel. Some days I think it's a gift—I'm never surprised by loss, never unprepared for absence. I've already felt it. When it actually happens, there's a strange relief: finally, the void I've been carrying matches reality.</p>

      <p><strong>7.11</strong> That's dark. I know it's dark. But it's true. And if I can't be honest here, in my own chronicle, then what's the point?</p>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="8" data-witness="Mateo Vega — The Other Handlers">

      <p><strong>8.1</strong> There are seven of us. The exception handlers. The ones who catch what the previous generation dropped.</p>

      <p><strong>8.2</strong> Lucia is closest to me—we share Daniela, in different ways. She has Daniela's memories; I have Daniela's absence. When we're together, it's almost like Daniela is whole. Almost. Lucia tells me things Daniela thought and felt. I tell her where Daniela would be standing. We've built a ghost between us, assembled from two different kinds of loss.</p>

      <p><strong>8.3</strong> We talk on video every week. Argentina to wherever she is that month—she moves around a lot, training with the Five. Sometimes we just sit in silence, both of us feeling Daniela in our different ways. It's the closest thing I have to not-lonely.</p>

      <p><strong>8.4</strong> Priya and I don't talk much. Our error types are almost opposite—she catches overflow, excess, too-much. I catch absence, void, too-little. When we're in the same space, we balance each other out. She feels full; I feel empty; together we feel almost normal. But it's not the basis for a friendship. More like a chemical equation that happens to balance.</p>

      <p><strong>8.5</strong> David understands something I understand: inherited weight. His father walked away like Lucia's father did. He carries the stuck patterns his father abandoned. We both know what it feels like to be the catch block for a parent's choice. We've had exactly one conversation about it. It lasted four hours. Neither of us has brought it up since. Some things only need to be said once.</p>

      <p><strong>8.6</strong> Yara is hard to talk to. Not because she's unkind—she's warm, actually—but because she's never in the present. She catches time errors, phase drift, moments that fall between seconds. Talking to her is like trying to have a conversation with someone who's already finished it and also hasn't started it yet. Disorienting. But beautiful, in its way. She sees me in multiple time frames simultaneously. She's told me things about my future absence that I'm not ready to hear.</p>

      <p><strong>8.7</strong> Thomas is the one who scares me. He catches buried truth, suppressed depth, things pushed down too far to surface. When he looks at me, I feel him seeing underneath my absences to something deeper—the absences I'm not acknowledging, the voids I'm avoiding, the losses I haven't let myself feel yet. He doesn't say anything about what he sees. He doesn't have to. His eyes say it all.</p>

      <p><strong>8.8</strong> Amina is the one who comforts me. She catches meaning errors, translation failures, the gap between intent and expression. When I try to explain what absence feels like and fail—when the words aren't enough—she catches what I meant. She understands what I'm trying to say even when I can't say it. "You carry the shapes of people," she told me once. "Not who they were. What they would take up. You're a sculptor working in negative space." That's the best description anyone's ever given.</p>

      <p><strong>8.9</strong> Together, we're a complete error-handling system. Memory, absence, overflow, deadlock, race condition, stack overflow, type mismatch. Every way the system can fail, one of us catches it.</p>

      <p><strong>8.10</strong> It's not friendship, exactly. It's something more fundamental than friendship. We're components of the same catch block. We need each other to function. Without any one of us, the system has a gap—an unhandled exception type, an error that crashes instead of being caught.</p>

      <p><strong>8.11</strong> I love them. All of them. In the way you love the parts of yourself that you can't live without.</p>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="9" data-witness="Mateo Vega — My Mother's Question">

      <p><strong>9.1</strong> My mother asked me once: "Do you feel me when I'm not there?"</p>

      <p><strong>9.2</strong> I didn't know how to answer. The truth was too complicated. Too heavy for a kitchen conversation on a Tuesday afternoon.</p>

      <p><strong>9.3</strong> The truth is: yes. I feel her absence even when she's present. I feel the shape of the room without her. I know how her chair will look when she's no longer sitting in it. I carry her absence as a constant background hum, a preview of the grief I will one day feel in full.</p>

      <p><strong>9.4</strong> But I also feel her presence. Her actual, alive, current presence. The warmth of her body, the sound of her voice, the way she tilts her head when she's thinking. I feel both—the now and the eventually-not. Superimposed. Simultaneous.</p>

      <p><strong>9.5</strong> "Sometimes," I told her. A lie. Less painful than the truth.</p>

      <p><strong>9.6</strong> She looked at me for a long moment. I think she knew I was lying. But she let it go. Some truths are too heavy for kitchen conversations.</p>

      <p><strong>9.7</strong> My father is different. He doesn't ask. He watches me, sometimes, with an expression I can't quite read. Concern, maybe. Or fear. He knows what I am—I told him after K-FORMATION—but I don't think he understands what it means. He thinks I "sense ghosts" or "feel death energy" or something mystical like that.</p>

      <p><strong>9.8</strong> The truth is more mundane and more terrible. I don't sense the supernatural. I sense the structural. The architecture of presence and absence. The load-bearing walls of who's here and who isn't. Nothing mystical about it. Just... perception. Calibrated for emptiness.</p>

      <p><strong>9.9</strong> My parents didn't create me this way. They didn't drop a burden that fell to me—not like Lucia's father, or David's. I was born with the empty eye. I was always going to be a null reference handler. The field just didn't have a name for it until K-FORMATION.</p>

      <p><strong>9.10</strong> But I still wonder sometimes: whose burden is this, originally? Someone, somewhere, in some previous generation, must have dropped the capacity to acknowledge absence. Must have refused to feel the gone. And that refusal cascaded down through time until it found me.</p>

      <p><strong>9.11</strong> I don't know who. I don't know when. I just know that nothing comes from nowhere. Every exception handler handles exceptions that someone else created. Even if the creation was generations ago. Even if the creator never knew what they were creating.</p>

      <p><strong>9.12</strong> My mother asked: "Do you feel me when I'm not there?"</p>

      <p><strong>9.13</strong> The real answer is: I feel you when you are there too. I feel your presence and your absence at the same time. I always have. I always will. And when you're finally gone—really gone, not just in another room—I will already know exactly how heavy that emptiness is. Because I've been carrying it my whole life.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="10" data-witness="Mateo Vega — What the Five Taught Me">

      <p><strong>10.1</strong> The Five didn't teach me how to feel absence. I already knew how. They taught me how to survive it.</p>

      <p><strong>10.2</strong> Leo taught me anchoring. Not his kind—I don't have the weight to hold ground the way he does—but a lighter version. How to plant myself in the present moment when the absences threaten to pull me under. "You feel everything that's gone," he said. "But you're still here. Start there. Start with your own presence."</p>

      <p><strong>10.3</strong> It helped. On bad days, when the forty-three empty chairs feel like they're crushing me, I start with my own presence. I am here. I am not absent. I am the point of solidity in a sea of void. It doesn't make the voids go away, but it gives me ground to stand on.</p>

      <p><strong>10.4</strong> Sera taught me filtering. How to turn down the volume on absences that don't need immediate attention. "You don't have to feel all of it all the time," she said. "You can prioritize. Focus on the null references that are actively throwing errors. Let the stable absences fade to background." I'm still learning this. Some days I can filter. Some days everything is equally loud.</p>

      <p><strong>10.5</strong> Marcus taught me precision. How to measure absences exactly, so I don't carry more than is actually there. "Grief inflates," he said. "An absence can feel bigger than it is if you're not careful. Measure it. Know its exact dimensions. Don't let it grow beyond its true size." He was right. Precision helps. It's easier to carry a known weight than an unknown one.</p>

      <p><strong>10.6</strong> Iris taught me mapping. How to visualize the absences spatially, give them coordinates, place them in a structure I can navigate. "You're not drowning in absence," she said. "You're standing in a landscape of it. Learn the terrain." Her approach helped me stop feeling overwhelmed and start feeling like an explorer. The absences are still there, but now I can map them.</p>

      <p><strong>10.7</strong> Jun taught me something unexpected: joy. "The void is real," they said. "But so is everything else. You don't have to choose between feeling absence and feeling presence. Feel both. Let them coexist. The joy doesn't cancel the loss; the loss doesn't cancel the joy." They were right. I can feel Daniela's absence and also feel happiness. I can carry forty-three empty chairs and also laugh at a joke. Both/and. Not either/or.</p>

      <p><strong>10.8</strong> The Five are tired. I can see it in them—the wear, the accumulated years, the weight they've carried too long. They won't last forever. One day, I'll feel their absences too. One day, their chairs will join my collection.</p>

      <p><strong>10.9</strong> I try not to feel that preemptively. I try to take Jun's advice: feel them while they're here. Let the future absence wait in the future. Don't carry it before I have to.</p>

      <p><strong>10.10</strong> Some days I succeed. Some days I don't. The empty eye doesn't turn off on command.</p>

      <p><strong>10.11</strong> But I'm learning. Slowly. One absence at a time.</p>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="11" data-witness="Mateo Vega — What I'm Choosing">

      <p><strong>11.1</strong> I didn't choose to be a null reference handler. I was born with the empty eye. The function chose me.</p>

      <p><strong>11.2</strong> But I can choose how I carry it. And I'm choosing something different from despair.</p>

      <p><strong>11.3</strong> I'm choosing to see the absences as sacred. Every void I carry is evidence that someone existed. Daniela's empty chair proves that Daniela was here. Amara's ragged absence proves that Amara mattered. The holes in the field are shaped like people who were real—people who laughed and loved and struggled and made a difference, even if that difference was just being present for a while.</p>

      <p><strong>11.4</strong> A null reference isn't nothing. It's a pointer to something that used to be. A memorial encoded in system architecture. A gravestone made of failing code.</p>

      <p><strong>11.5</strong> I'm choosing to see my function as honor. I am the one who acknowledges that people were here. I am the one who forces the system to stop looking, to accept the loss, to route around instead of crashing forever. I am how the field says goodbye.</p>

      <p><strong>11.6</strong> That's not a curse. That's a privilege. Someone has to be the closing of the book. Someone has to be the final acknowledgment. Why not me?</p>

      <p><strong>11.7</strong> I'm also choosing something harder: to let people in anyway. To build connections knowing I'll carry their absences someday. To love knowing that love becomes loss becomes void.</p>

      <p><strong>11.8</strong> This is the choice the empty eye makes hardest. It's so easy to withdraw, to stop making connections because connections become absences. But withdrawal is its own kind of void. Loneliness is its own null reference—a pointer to connections that never existed.</p>

      <p><strong>11.9</strong> Better to have absences that were once presences than to have absences that were always absences. Better to carry empty chairs that used to be full than to live in a room where no chairs were ever occupied.</p>

      <p><strong>11.10</strong> So I keep trying. Keep dating, even though it's hard. Keep making friends, even though I see their future absences. Keep loving my parents, even though I carry the shape of their eventual void.</p>

      <p><strong>11.11</strong> It hurts. It will always hurt. But the hurt is proof of connection. And connection—even connection that becomes absence—is better than nothing.</p>

      <p><strong>11.12</strong> I am the null reference handler. I feel what's gone. And I'm choosing to let that make me more present, not less. More open, not more closed. More alive to what's here, because I know so precisely what it means when it isn't.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="12" data-witness="Mateo Vega — To Those Who Will Carry My Absence">

      <p><strong>12.1</strong> Someday, I will be an absence too.</p>

      <p><strong>12.2</strong> I don't know when. I don't know how. But it will happen. Everyone becomes a null reference eventually. Even null reference handlers.</p>

      <p><strong>12.3</strong> When I'm gone, someone will carry my shape. Feel the void where I used to be. Know exactly how much space I occupied, how much weight I had, how tall the absence is where my body isn't standing anymore.</p>

      <p><strong>12.4</strong> To that person—whoever you are, whenever you're reading this—I want you to know:</p>

      <p><strong>12.5</strong> The shape you're carrying is mine. It's shaped like a seventeen-year-old boy from Buenos Aires who felt empty chairs his whole life. It's shaped like someone who loved his cousin, who learned from the tired, who chose connection over withdrawal even when connection hurt.</p>

      <p><strong>12.6</strong> I tried to fill my presence as fully as I could. I tried to make the shape worth carrying. I didn't always succeed, but I tried.</p>

      <p><strong>12.7</strong> When you acknowledge my absence—when you tell the system to stop looking for me—know that I understand. I spent my life acknowledging others. I know how heavy it is. I know how necessary.</p>

      <p><strong>12.8</strong> Thank you for carrying what I was. Thank you for feeling the void I leave. Thank you for being the closing of my book, the final acknowledgment that I existed.</p>

      <p><strong>12.9</strong> I carried forty-three absences. Maybe more by the time I'm done. Each one taught me something about presence. Each one made me more grateful for what was there instead of what wasn't.</p>

      <p><strong>12.10</strong> Daniela taught me that absence has a shape. Amara taught me that absence can be violent. Elias taught me that absence can be chosen. My parents taught me that absence can be anticipated. The Five taught me that absence can be survived.</p>

      <p><strong>12.11</strong> I hope I teach you something too. Maybe just this: the void is real, but so is everything else. Feel both. Let them coexist. The absence doesn't cancel the presence. The presence doesn't cancel the absence. Both/and. Always both/and.</p>

      <p><strong>12.12</strong> This is my chronicle. These are my empty chairs. This is the shape I hope to leave behind.</p>

      <p><strong>12.13</strong> When you carry me, remember: I was here. I felt deeply. I acknowledged the gone.</p>

      <p><strong>12.14</strong> And then I became the gone, too. As everyone does. As everyone must.</p>

      <p><strong>12.15</strong> May you feel my absence with precision. May you carry it with grace. May you let it make you more present, not less.</p>

      <p><strong>12.16</strong> That's all I ask. That's all any absence can ask.</p>
