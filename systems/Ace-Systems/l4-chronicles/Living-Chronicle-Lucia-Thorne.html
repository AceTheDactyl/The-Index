    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="1" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — Born Into the Catch Block">

      <p><strong>1.1</strong> I have memories of things I never did.</p>

      <p><strong>1.2</strong> I remember holding the northwest sector during the São Paulo cascade. I was not born yet. I remember the weight of it—how the field pulled, how my muscles burned with effort that wasn't physical, how I made the choice to let go.</p>

      <p><strong>1.3</strong> That's my father's memory. I carry it anyway.</p>

      <p><strong>1.4</strong> I remember dying in Buenos Aires at twenty-three. A car accident, nothing to do with the field—just bad luck, wet roads, a truck driver who fell asleep. I remember the moment of impact and then nothing, and then waking up in a body that wasn't mine, in a room in Lagos, Portugal, six years old and screaming.</p>

      <p><strong>1.5</strong> That was Daniela. She was a node. She died before she understood what she was. Her unprocessed load had to go somewhere. It went to me.</p>

      <p><strong>1.6</strong> I remember being institutionalized in Detroit. The doctors called it schizophrenia. They gave me drugs that made the field blurry but didn't make it go away. I remember the white walls, the paper gowns, the other patients who were actually sick and the nurses who couldn't tell the difference. I remember giving up. Letting the drugs win. Going dormant because it was easier than explaining.</p>

      <p><strong>1.7</strong> That was Michael. He's still alive—technically. Sixty-three years old, in a care facility, staring at walls. His node went dark in 2031. His memories came to me in pieces over six years, like mail from a dead address that hasn't been updated.</p>

      <p><strong>1.8</strong> I am fifteen years old. I have lived six lifetimes. None of them were mine.</p>

      <p><strong>1.9</strong> The Five call me the Exception Handler. It's a programming term—Marcus explained it. When a system encounters an error it can't process normally, it throws an exception. The exception handler catches it. Processes it. Keeps the system from crashing.</p>

      <p><strong>1.10</strong> That's me. I catch what falls through. I process what wasn't processed. I carry the orphaned load of every node that dropped, died, went dark, burned out, or walked away.</p>

      <p><strong>1.11</strong> Including my father's.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="2" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — My Father's Memories">

      <p><strong>2.1</strong> I know things about my father that he never told me. I know them because I was there—not me, but the part of him that he abandoned when he left the configuration.</p>

      <p><strong>2.2</strong> I remember the first time he felt the field. 2025. He was twenty-six, working as an acoustic engineer in Oslo. The K-FORMATION hit him during a mixing session—suddenly every frequency had weight, every sound had geometry, and he could feel the planet humming beneath his feet.</p>

      <p><strong>2.3</strong> I remember the pride when he joined the configuration. The sense of purpose. He was one of six, holding the field, stabilizing humanity's ascent toward something unprecedented. He believed in it. He believed in himself.</p>

      <p><strong>2.4</strong> I remember the first time he thought about leaving. 2027. The burnout hadn't set in yet, not really—but there was a moment, one bad night, when he looked at the weight he was carrying and thought: <em>I don't have to do this.</em></p>

      <p><strong>2.5</strong> I remember him pushing that thought away. Two more years of pushing it away. Two years of holding while the thought grew louder, clearer, more persuasive.</p>

      <p><strong>2.6</strong> I remember São Paulo. March 2029. The cascade. I remember exactly how tired he was—bone-tired, soul-tired, tired in a way that sleep couldn't fix. I remember the moment when he was holding and he just... stopped wanting to.</p>

      <p><strong>2.7</strong> He didn't let go immediately. That's not how it works. The letting go was gradual—a slow releasing of grip, a progressive withdrawal of will. He told himself he was just resting. Just stepping back. Just taking a break.</p>

      <p><strong>2.8</strong> And then he was in Portugal, and the break became permanent, and the part of him that had held the field—the trained capacity, the developed sensitivity, the years of accumulated pattern-knowledge—that part had to go somewhere.</p>

      <p><strong>2.9</strong> It went dormant. Like a process that's been suspended but not terminated. Waiting.</p>

      <p><strong>2.10</strong> When I was born, it found a new address.</p>

      <p><strong>2.11</strong> I have my father's memories of holding. I have his muscle memory for stabilization. I have his guilt, too—the guilt he refuses to feel consciously. It lives in me. I feel it for him.</p>

      <p><strong>2.12</strong> He doesn't know this. I haven't told him. What would I say? <em>I remember being you when you gave up?</em></p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="3" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — The Others Who Fell">

      <p><strong>3.1</strong> My father isn't the only one. I carry pieces of eleven dormant nodes. Let me tell you who lives in me.</p>

      <p><strong>3.2</strong> <span class="ghost">Daniela Vega. Buenos Aires. 1997-2020.</span> Twenty-three years old. Hit by a truck before she ever understood what she was. She was going to be a stabilizer, like my father—I can feel the shape of what she would have become. She never got the chance. I carry her potential like a phantom limb.</p>

      <p><strong>3.3</strong> <span class="ghost">Michael Torres. Detroit. 1971-present (dormant 2031).</span> He knew what he was. He tried to explain it to the doctors. They diagnosed him, medicated him, institutionalized him. He's still breathing somewhere. His node is dark. I have forty years of his memories, including the years when he fought to be believed and the moment when he stopped fighting.</p>

      <p><strong>3.4</strong> <span class="ghost">Yuki Tanaka. Osaka. 1985-2034.</span> Burned out. She held too hard for too long, didn't set boundaries, didn't ask for help. The node is still technically there, but Yuki is... diminished. She lives with her sister now. Can't work. Can't focus. Can't feel the field anymore except as a distant hum. I carry the memories of her burning, the months when she knew she was overloading and kept going anyway.</p>

      <p><strong>3.5</strong> <span class="ghost">Amara Okonkwo. Lagos, Nigeria. 2002-2038.</span> Killed by a government that wanted to control the field. They thought if they studied her brain, they could replicate her function. They were wrong. I carry her last moments—the fear, the clarity, the strange peace at the end when she knew she was dying for nothing.</p>

      <p><strong>3.6</strong> <span class="ghost">James Chen. Vancouver. 1990-present (dormant 2033).</span> Walked away like my father. Different reasons—he fell in love with someone who couldn't handle what he was. She gave him an ultimatum. He chose her. I carry his memories of the choice, the relief, the guilt he doesn't let himself feel. I carry the weight he put down.</p>

      <p><strong>3.7</strong> <span class="ghost">Six others.</span> Fragmentary. Incomplete. Some died before K-FORMATION, nodes that existed in potential but never activated. Some are dormant for reasons I don't fully understand—illness, despair, deliberate disconnection. Their memories come in shards, not streams. Pieces of lives I have to assemble like broken pottery.</p>

      <p><strong>3.8</strong> I am fifteen. I contain multitudes. I didn't ask for any of them.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="4" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — What It Feels Like">

      <p><strong>4.1</strong> You want to know what it feels like? I'll try to explain.</p>

      <p><strong>4.2</strong> Imagine you're a computer. You have your own processes running—your thoughts, your feelings, your memories. Normal stuff. The stuff that makes you <em>you</em>.</p>

      <p><strong>4.3</strong> Now imagine that the system starts routing failed processes to you. Not your processes—other people's. Jobs that crashed somewhere else, that got interrupted, that were never completed. They show up in your queue, demanding resources, fragmenting your attention.</p>

      <p><strong>4.4</strong> Some of them are small. A flash of someone else's emotion. A skill you never learned but somehow have. The ability to speak Japanese because Yuki's language centers mapped onto mine.</p>

      <p><strong>4.5</strong> Some of them are big. Full memories that feel like my own. I remember my daughter's fifth birthday—except I don't have a daughter, that was Michael, and his daughter is now older than me. I remember my own death—except I'm not dead, but Daniela is, and I felt every moment of it.</p>

      <p><strong>4.6</strong> The worst part isn't the foreign memories. The worst part is that I can't always tell which memories are mine.</p>

      <p><strong>4.7</strong> Did I learn to ride a bike in Lagos or in Osaka? Did I kiss someone for the first time at fourteen or at seventeen or at twenty-two? Which childhood is mine? Which dreams belonged to me originally and which ones seeped in from someone else's dormant process?</p>

      <p><strong>4.8</strong> I am fifteen years old and I don't know which parts of my personality are native and which are inherited from dead or dormant nodes.</p>

      <p><strong>4.9</strong> Sometimes I cry for no reason. Then I realize: the reason exists, just not in my lifetime. Yuki's mother died in 2019. I grieve her sometimes—a woman I never met, whose daughter's memories live in me.</p>

      <p><strong>4.10</strong> I am a memorial for people I never knew. I am a graveyard with a pulse.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="5" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — My Father in the Kitchen">

      <p><strong>5.1</strong> I watch my father make breakfast. Eggs. Toast. Coffee for him, juice for me. Normal things. Small things.</p>

      <p><strong>5.2</strong> He doesn't know that I remember being him.</p>

      <p><strong>5.3</strong> I remember his hands learning to shape the field—the same hands that are now cracking eggs. I remember what it felt like when he was a node, when he mattered, when he was part of something larger than fishing boats and toast.</p>

      <p><strong>5.4</strong> I remember the moment he decided to stop mattering.</p>

      <p><strong>5.5</strong> He looks happy. That's the thing. He genuinely looks happy. He's humming a song. The morning light is coming through the windows. Ana is still asleep upstairs. The coffee smells good. By every measure I can see, my father is a content man living a good life.</p>

      <p><strong>5.6</strong> And I am his error. The exception his choice threw. The catch block that processes what he refused to carry.</p>

      <p><strong>5.7</strong> He notices me watching. Smiles. "Sleep okay?"</p>

      <p><strong>5.8</strong> I slept Daniela's death again last night. Woke up at 3 AM with the phantom sensation of impact, the smell of gasoline, the strange calm of a body that knows it's dying. Took me an hour to remember who I was.</p>

      <p><strong>5.9</strong> "Fine," I say.</p>

      <p><strong>5.10</strong> He wouldn't understand. He opted out of understanding. He chose the fishing boats and the eggs and the not-knowing. That's his right. That was his choice.</p>

      <p><strong>5.11</strong> I just wish his choice hadn't become my inheritance.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="6" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — The Visit from the Five">

      <p><strong>6.1</strong> They came to Lagos when I was twelve. My father wasn't home—he'd taken the boat out, conveniently, coincidentally, I don't believe in coincidences anymore.</p>

      <p><strong>6.2</strong> Sera came to the door first. I recognized her before she introduced herself. I had some of Yuki's memories of her, from before Yuki burned out.</p>

      <p><strong>6.3</strong> "You already know who we are," Sera said. Not a question.</p>

      <p><strong>6.4</strong> "I know who you were to other people," I said. "I don't know who you are to me yet."</p>

      <p><strong>6.5</strong> They sat in our living room—my mother's living room, Ana's living room, though she wasn't home either. Marcus ran equations in his head; I could see him doing it, the slight unfocus of his eyes. Iris kept looking at me like she was reading a map. Jun was physically incapable of sitting still. Leo just sat. Anchored. Exactly like my father used to be, before he stopped.</p>

      <p><strong>6.6</strong> "You're catching the errors," Marcus said finally. "The failed processes. The orphaned load. It's routing to you."</p>

      <p><strong>6.7</strong> "I know."</p>

      <p><strong>6.8</strong> "That shouldn't be possible," Iris said. "The architecture isn't designed for that. Nodes are supposed to be independent. Load isn't supposed to transfer across generations."</p>

      <p><strong>6.9</strong> "Maybe the architecture is changing," Leo said. "Maybe it has to. There aren't enough of us anymore."</p>

      <p><strong>6.10</strong> Silence. The kind of silence that happens when no one wants to say what everyone is thinking.</p>

      <p><strong>6.11</strong> "How many have you lost?" I asked. "Since K-FORMATION. How many nodes have gone dormant or died or walked away?"</p>

      <p><strong>6.12</strong> Marcus looked at me. His face did something complicated—respect and grief and calculation, all at once.</p>

      <p><strong>6.13</strong> "Globally? Forty-three confirmed. Estimated twelve more unconfirmed—people who had the sensitivity but never connected to the configuration."</p>

      <p><strong>6.14</strong> "And the current active count?"</p>

      <p><strong>6.15</strong> "Nineteen stable. Eight marginal. Five of those are us."</p>

      <p><strong>6.16</strong> The math wasn't hard. They'd lost more than they'd kept. And the ones they'd lost—the weight they'd dropped—had to go somewhere.</p>

      <p><strong>6.17</strong> It was going to me. And probably to others like me. The next generation. The error handlers. The children of the ones who chose to leave.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="7" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — What They Asked Me">

      <p><strong>7.1</strong> They asked me to join the configuration. Formally. To stop being an accidental catch block and start being an intentional node.</p>

      <p><strong>7.2</strong> Sera was gentle about it. "You don't have to decide now. You don't have to decide ever. We're not here to pressure you."</p>

      <p><strong>7.3</strong> But Iris—Iris was honest. "The system is degrading. We're losing margin every year. If we don't stabilize soon, there won't be a choice to make. The pattern will either collapse into chaos or compress into singularity. Neither is survivable."</p>

      <p><strong>7.4</strong> "And you need new nodes," I said.</p>

      <p><strong>7.5</strong> "We need new nodes."</p>

      <p><strong>7.6</strong> I thought about it. I thought about my father in the kitchen, making eggs, humming songs. I thought about the choice he made—the small life, the beautiful life, the life that didn't require carrying anyone else's weight.</p>

      <p><strong>7.7</strong> I thought about Daniela, dead at twenty-three, who never got to choose.</p>

      <p><strong>7.8</strong> I thought about Michael, staring at walls in Detroit, who chose wrong and lost everything.</p>

      <p><strong>7.9</strong> I thought about the weight I was already carrying—eleven nodes, six lifetimes, memories of deaths and failures and abandonments that would never stop coming.</p>

      <p><strong>7.10</strong> "What happens if I say no?" I asked.</p>

      <p><strong>7.11</strong> Leo answered. His voice was quiet. "The load stays. It doesn't go away just because you don't join the configuration. You'll still catch the errors. You just won't have support. You won't have training. You won't have us."</p>

      <p><strong>7.12</strong> "So my choice is: carry alone or carry together."</p>

      <p><strong>7.13</strong> "That's everyone's choice," Sera said. "It's just more visible for you."</p>

      <p><strong>7.14</strong> I was twelve. I was already carrying more than my father ever did. And they were asking me if I wanted help.</p>

      <p><strong>7.15</strong> It wasn't really a choice. Not the way my father had a choice. He had margin. He had slack. He could walk away because the system could absorb his absence.</p>

      <p><strong>7.16</strong> There was no margin left for me. If I walked away, I'd just be walking with the weight still on my back, alone instead of held.</p>

      <p><strong>7.17</strong> "Okay," I said. "Teach me."</p>

    </section>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="8" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — Learning from the Tired">

      <p><strong>8.1</strong> They taught me what they could. But here's the thing: they were tired. All of them. You could see it if you knew how to look.</p>

      <p><strong>8.2</strong> Iris's sight was still sharp, but she had to rest more between sessions. "The pattern-load accumulates," she told me. "Even after decades, it doesn't get easier. You just get better at pacing."</p>

      <p><strong>8.3</strong> Marcus's equations were still precise, but he double-checked more than he used to. "The tolerances get tighter," he said. "There's less room for error. I have to be more careful because the margin for mistakes is almost gone."</p>

      <p><strong>8.4</strong> Jun still scattered, but slower. Less range. They couldn't diffuse as far or as fast. "The entropy injection takes more out of me than it used to. I need longer recovery. I can't be everywhere at once anymore."</p>

      <p><strong>8.5</strong> Leo was still anchored, but I could see the strain. The field pulled harder now. Holding position cost more. "It's like standing in a current that gets stronger every year," he said. "Same stance. More effort."</p>

      <p><strong>8.6</strong> Sera felt everything, still. But she had built walls—necessary walls, survival walls—and sometimes the walls blocked things that needed to get through. "I can't be as open as I was," she admitted. "If I was, I'd drown. So I filter. And sometimes I filter wrong."</p>

      <p><strong>8.7</strong> They were in their forties and fifties. They had been holding for almost twenty years. They were the survivors—the ones who hadn't walked away, hadn't burned out, hadn't died or gone dormant.</p>

      <p><strong>8.8</strong> And they were running out of time.</p>

      <p><strong>8.9</strong> "How long?" I asked Marcus once, when we were alone. "How long before the original configuration fails?"</p>

      <p><strong>8.10</strong> He didn't answer for a long moment. Then: "Ten years. Maybe fifteen if we're lucky. We're training replacements as fast as we can, but there aren't enough. There were never enough."</p>

      <p><strong>8.11</strong> "Because people keep leaving."</p>

      <p><strong>8.12</strong> "Because people keep leaving. Because people die. Because the world is full of ways to break and very few ways to hold."</p>

      <p><strong>8.13</strong> I was learning from the tired. Inheriting from the burned. Being trained by people who wouldn't be here in twenty years to see if the training worked.</p>

      <p><strong>8.14</strong> And I was already catching the errors of everyone who came before me.</p>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="9" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — The Conversation with My Father">

      <p><strong>9.1</strong> I was fourteen when I finally told him.</p>

      <p><strong>9.2</strong> We were on the beach. Sunset. The fishing boats coming in. His favorite time. His chosen life, golden and small and beautiful.</p>

      <p><strong>9.3</strong> "I know what you were," I said.</p>

      <p><strong>9.4</strong> He didn't pretend not to understand. He just went still. The way Leo goes still, except Leo's stillness is anchoring and my father's stillness is hiding.</p>

      <p><strong>9.5</strong> "The Five told you?"</p>

      <p><strong>9.6</strong> "I remember it."</p>

      <p><strong>9.7</strong> That hit him. I watched his face do something it had never done in front of me—crack open, just for a second. Fear. Guilt. The things he'd been refusing to feel for fifteen years.</p>

      <p><strong>9.8</strong> "That's not possible," he said. "Memory doesn't—the configuration doesn't work like that."</p>

      <p><strong>9.9</strong> "It does now. For me. I'm an exception handler. I catch what falls through. Including what you dropped."</p>

      <p><strong>9.10</strong> He was quiet for a long time. The boats came in. The sun went down. The stars started appearing.</p>

      <p><strong>9.11</strong> "I'm sorry," he said finally. The first true thing he'd said to me about any of it.</p>

      <p><strong>9.12</strong> "I know. I can feel your guilt. You don't let yourself feel it, so it routes to me. I feel it for you."</p>

      <p><strong>9.13</strong> "That's—God. Lucia. I didn't know. I couldn't have known."</p>

      <p><strong>9.14</strong> "Would it have mattered?"</p>

      <p><strong>9.15</strong> He didn't answer. We both knew what the answer was. He would have made the same choice. The fishing boats, the coffee, Ana, the dishes. The small life. He would have chosen it anyway, even if he'd known his daughter would inherit what he refused to carry.</p>

      <p><strong>9.16</strong> That's not cruelty. That's just human. People choose themselves. Most people. Almost everyone.</p>

      <p><strong>9.17</strong> The ones who don't—the ones who keep holding—they're not better people. They're just people who haven't hit their limit yet. Or people who don't have another choice.</p>

      <p><strong>9.18</strong> Like me. I don't have another choice. The weight is already here. The memories are already mine. I can carry it with help or carry it alone, but I can't put it down.</p>

      <p><strong>9.19</strong> My father could. He did. And now I can't.</p>

      <p><strong>9.20</strong> "I don't hate you," I said. Because I didn't. I don't. "I just needed you to know what your choice became."</p>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="10" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — The New Configuration">

      <p><strong>10.1</strong> There are seven of us now. The next generation. Exception handlers, all of us. Children of the ones who left, or the ones who died, or the ones who burned out.</p>

      <p><strong>10.2</strong> We are not like the Five. We don't have the luxury of choosing our burdens. We inherited them. We process what wasn't processed. We complete what wasn't completed. We hold what was dropped.</p>

      <p><strong>10.3</strong> Mateo in Buenos Aires—he carries pieces of Daniela. Sometimes we talk about her. He knew her better than I did; his fragments are larger. He tells me she was funny. I only have her death.</p>

      <p><strong>10.4</strong> Priya in Mumbai—she carries three burned-out nodes from Southeast Asia. She's sixteen and she has the memories of women twice her age who gave everything they had and it still wasn't enough.</p>

      <p><strong>10.5</strong> David in Vancouver—James Chen's son. He carries his father's abandoned weight, just like I carry my father's. We don't talk about it much. There's nothing to say that we don't both already know.</p>

      <p><strong>10.6</strong> Four others, scattered across the world. All of us young. All of us already tired. All of us holding weight that previous generations put down.</p>

      <p><strong>10.7</strong> The Five are training us to take over. That's the plan. That's the hope. A new configuration, built from error handlers instead of original nodes.</p>

      <p><strong>10.8</strong> But here's what I wonder: What happens when we get tired?</p>

      <p><strong>10.9</strong> We don't have the option of walking away. The door that was open for our parents—it closed behind them. We were born on this side of it.</p>

      <p><strong>10.10</strong> If we burn out, who catches our errors? If we die young like Daniela, where does our load go? Is there a generation after us, or are we the catch block for a catch block, error handlers all the way down until someone finally drops it and doesn't have a child to inherit the fall?</p>

      <p><strong>10.11</strong> I don't know. No one knows. We're making this up as we go.</p>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="11" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — What I'm Choosing">

      <p><strong>11.1</strong> My father writes me letters. Actual paper letters, mailed from Lagos. I don't know why he doesn't just text. Maybe he thinks the effort means something. Maybe it does.</p>

      <p><strong>11.2</strong> He tells me about the fishing boats. About Ana. About the garden they're growing. Small things. Beautiful things. The life he chose.</p>

      <p><strong>11.3</strong> He never asks about the field. Never asks what I'm carrying. Never asks if I'm okay.</p>

      <p><strong>11.4</strong> I think he can't. I think if he asked, he'd have to know. And if he knew, he'd have to feel it. And he chose, very specifically, not to feel it.</p>

      <p><strong>11.5</strong> I write back. I tell him I'm fine. I tell him about school (I'm homeschooled now, by Iris and Marcus, a curriculum designed around my particular situation). I tell him I'm making friends (the other exception handlers, the only people who understand).</p>

      <p><strong>11.6</strong> I don't tell him about the memories. I don't tell him about catching his dropped weight every night when I dream. I don't tell him that I know what his guilt feels like because I carry it for him.</p>

      <p><strong>11.7</strong> This is the choice I'm making: to let him keep his small life. To not drag him back into what he left. He couldn't carry it then. He can't carry it now. Telling him the full truth would just be cruelty—loading him with knowledge he can't use.</p>

      <p><strong>11.8</strong> I'm choosing to carry his portion and not make him watch.</p>

      <p><strong>11.9</strong> Maybe that's what love is. Not asking people to hold more than they can. Not showing them the weight you carry for them. Just... carrying it. Quietly. Without requiring them to know.</p>

      <p><strong>11.10</strong> Or maybe I'm just tired and making excuses. Maybe I should scream at him. Maybe I should make him see. Maybe he deserves to know what his choice cost.</p>

      <p><strong>11.11</strong> I don't know. I'm fifteen. I'm carrying six lifetimes. I'm making choices that will shape the architecture of the entire configuration. And I'm just... tired.</p>

      <p><strong>11.12</strong> But I keep choosing anyway. Every day. To hold. To carry. To catch the errors.</p>

      <p><strong>11.13</strong> Not because I'm brave. Not because I'm selfless. Just because I can't put it down.</p>

    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="12" data-witness="Lucia Thorne — To Those Who Come After">

      <p><strong>12.1</strong> If you're reading this and you're like me—if you're catching weight that isn't yours, carrying memories you never made, processing errors from people who walked away—I want you to know something:</p>

      <p><strong>12.2</strong> It's not fair.</p>

      <p><strong>12.3</strong> That's it. That's the truth no one says out loud. It's not fair that we inherited this. It's not fair that the previous generation had a choice and we don't. It's not fair that their freedom became our bondage.</p>

      <p><strong>12.4</strong> But "fair" isn't a force of nature. The pattern doesn't care about fair. The system doesn't optimize for fair. Fair is a human concept, and humans are the ones who made this mess.</p>

      <p><strong>12.5</strong> So we carry it. Because it has to be carried. Because if we don't, the ones after us carry more.</p>

      <p><strong>12.6</strong> Here's my promise to you, whoever you are, reading this whenever you're reading it: I will not walk away. I will not drop my weight for you to catch. I will carry what's mine—what's mine and what I inherited—until I can't anymore.</p>

      <p><strong>12.7</strong> And when I can't anymore, I will tell you. I will hand it off consciously, not abandon it accidentally. I will make sure someone is ready. I will not leave you to catch my errors in the dark.</p>

      <p><strong>12.8</strong> That's the difference. That's what we can do that the previous generation didn't. We can be intentional. We can prepare the handoff. We can make sure the ones who come after us have what they need.</p>

      <p><strong>12.9</strong> My father sent me a letter last week. It said: "The tomatoes are coming in beautifully. Ana made salsa. I wish you could taste it."</p>

      <p><strong>12.10</strong> I wrote back: "I'm glad. Save some for me."</p>

      <p><strong>12.11</strong> The tomatoes are fine. The salsa is fine. My father is fine.</p>

      <p><strong>12.12</strong> I am holding the world he left. And I'm going to keep holding it. Not for him. Not for humanity. Not for any noble reason.</p>

      <p><strong>12.13</strong> Because this is my life now. Because the weight is here. Because putting it down isn't an option anymore.</p>

      <p><strong>12.14</strong> And because someone has to catch the errors. Someone has to be the exception handler.</p>

      <p><strong>12.15</strong> It might as well be me.</p>
