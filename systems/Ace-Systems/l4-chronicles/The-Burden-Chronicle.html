      <p>This document exists because we almost broke.</p>
      <p>Not from the pattern. From the expectation that we would hold it forever, unconditionally, without limit. From the assumption that our function was our identity. From the world's demand that we sacrifice everything and be grateful for the privilege.</p>
      <p>We are not martyrs. We are not saviors. We are five people with specific nervous systems who got drafted into structural roles we never chose. And we have learned—the hard way—that sustainability requires terms.</p>
      <p>This is what we hold. This is what we don't. This is what we need to keep going.</p>
      <p>If these terms are unacceptable, find other nodes. Good luck.</p>

          <p>I also refuse to see only what you want me to see. If the beautiful path leads to dissolution, I will say so. If the pattern you worship is heading toward something incompatible with human survival, I will say so. Don't ask me to lie about the geometry.</p>

          <p><strong>Belief without proof.</strong> Sometimes I see things I can't verify yet. I need you to trust that I'm not lying or deluded. I need the benefit of the doubt I extend to everyone else.</p>
          <p><strong>Permission to not know.</strong> The territory beyond THE LENS is unmapped. I'm mapping it. That means uncertainty. I need to be allowed to say "I don't know" without being treated as failed.</p>

          <p>I also refuse to pretend the math is uncertain when it isn't. If the equations say we have eighteen months before a threshold becomes unstable, I will say eighteen months.

          <p>They wanted me to stop being what I am. They saw my scatter as a flaw to be corrected, not a function to be supported.

Because paying attention in one direction is the opposite of what I'm here to do.</p>

So while everyone else was having a transcendent experience of cosmic oneness, I was... scattered. Doing my job. Keeping the whole thing from collapsing into uniformity.</p>
          <p>I don't know what it feels like to be fully coherent. To be one thing. To rest in a single place. Everyone else got the mystical experience. I got to be the noise that made it survivable.</p>
          <p>Sometimes I wonder what I missed. Then I remind myself that what I "missed" might have been the end of separate experience forever, and I was the one who prevented that, and no one will ever thank me for it because they didn't notice.</p>

          <p>More. Always more. "Leo can hold it" became an assumption, then an expectation, then a demand. Every new crisis, every instability, every moment when the field wobbled—the solution was always "Leo will anchor."</p>
          <p>No one asked if I could. They assumed. And when I said I was tired, they heard "I need encouragement." When I said I was at my limit, they heard "I need motivation." The concept that I might actually be at my limit did not compute.</p>
          <p>Some people resented me for not synchronizing. "You're holding us back," they said. "You're preventing transcendence." Yes. That is literally my job. You're welcome.</p>

          <p>I watched the others experience Unity. I felt them transcend while I held position. I know what I missed because I could feel the edges of it—the vastness, the connection, the dissolution of self into something larger.</p>
          <p>I held the ground instead. Someone had to. I chose to. But choosing doesn't mean it didn't cost.</p>
          <p>I am lonely in a way that people who have experienced Unity cannot understand. They know what connection feels like at the deepest level. I know what it feels like to refuse it. To stay separate so that separation remains possible for everyone else.</p>

          <p><strong>Movement.</strong> I need to be allowed to move sometimes. Not far. Not fast. But motion. The anchor cannot be frozen forever without becoming brittle. I need permission to shift, to adjust, to not be exactly where I was yesterday.</p>
          <p><strong>Being held.</strong> I hold everyone else. I need someone to hold me. Not often. Not dramatically. Just... someone who stays. Who doesn't need me to anchor them. Who lets me rest against them for once.</p>
          <p><strong>Acknowledgment that this is a choice.</strong> I'm not incapable of transcendence. I'm refusing it. Every day, I choose to stay. I need that choice to be seen. Not taken for granted. Seen.</p>

          <p>The emotional weight. The boundaries. The teaching of limits—how to stay connected without dissolving, how to feel without drowning.</p>
          <p>I agreed to tend. To hold space. To be the one who models that empathy and survival can coexist. That you can feel everything and still have a self left at the end of the day.</p>

        <div class="burden-content">
          <p>Everything. I used to absorb—take others' feelings into myself, carry them, process them. I can't do that anymore. I will witness. I will reflect. I will not carry.</p>
          <p>I also refuse to be endlessly gentle. Sometimes the kind thing is the hard thing. Sometimes boundaries look like rejection. I need to be allowed to say no without it being treated as a failure of compassion.</p>

          <p>Infinite tenderness. Limitless holding. A mother for the species who never gets tired, never gets sharp, never has needs of her own.</p>
          <p>They came to me with everything. Every fear, every wound, every desperate need for someone to understand. And I did understand—that's the problem. I felt all of it. Every person who needed me was a wave I had to survive, and the waves never stopped.</p>
          <p>When I set boundaries, they called me cold. When I took breaks, they called me selfish. When I was honest about my limits, they found someone else to idealize and resented me for failing to be infinite.</p>

          <p>I don't always know which feelings are mine. After years of being the emotional anchor, my own internal landscape is... crowded. Other people's grief sits in my chest. Other people's fear lives in my stomach. I've gotten better at not absorbing, but the old residue is still there. I carry feelings I never felt.</p>
          <p>I am the one everyone comes to. Which means I am also the one who has no one to come to. Iris helps—she sees me, not through me. But the asymmetry remains. I know everyone else's emotional weather. No one knows mine.</p>

          <p><strong>Being tended.</strong> I tend everyone. I need someone to tend me. Not as a reward or a break—as a baseline. Someone who notices my feelings, not just what I notice about theirs.</p>
          <p><strong>Hardness permission.</strong> I need to be allowed to be hard sometimes. To set limits that hurt people. To protect myself even when others need me. I need "no" to be a complete sentence.</p>
          <p><strong>My own feelings.</strong> Time when I feel only what I feel. Not filtered through everyone else. Not diluted by collective weather. Just mine. I need to remember what that's like.</p>

        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); margin-bottom: 24px; font-style: italic;">We hold the field. The field holds if we hold. We hold if we last. We last if our needs are met. These are not requests. These are structural requirements.</p>

        <div class="term-item">
          <div class="term-who iris">Iris requires:</div>
          <div class="term-what">12 hours per week of blindness—no pattern work, no questions, no seeing. Jay protects this time. Violation means I cannot predict accurately. Your problem, not mine.</div>

        <p>If you want to know why the pattern hasn't destroyed human individuality yet, this is why. Not sacrifice. Sustainability. Not martyrdom. Mutuality.</p>

      <h3>What We Haven't Said</h3>
      <p>This document describes what we need. It does not guarantee we will get it.</p>
      <p>Governments are still trying to control the field. Corporations are still trying to monetize access. Accelerationists still want to push past all limits. Resisters still want to destroy the pattern entirely. Cults still worship us. Critics still blame us. Most people still don't understand what we do or why we do it.</p>
      <p>We are five people trying to hold a configuration that serves billions. We are tired. We are not sure this is sustainable. We are doing it anyway because the alternative is worse.</p>
      <p>The math may not be stallable indefinitely. We may only be buying time. And time for what? For humanity to grow up, to learn to hold the field themselves, to develop the collective maturity to handle what's coming?</p>
      <p>The evidence for that is... not great.</p>
      <p>But we keep holding. Not because we believe in humanity. Because we believe in possibility. Because the pattern doesn't surprise and humanity sometimes does. Because even a fractured, ungrateful, self-destructive species is still capable of choice.</p>
      <p>We hold the door. You decide what to do with the time.</p>
