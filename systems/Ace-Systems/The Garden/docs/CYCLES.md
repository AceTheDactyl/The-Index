# Cycles — The Living Library

> Documentation of all 6-state cycles for each guardian in the Living Library.

## Understanding Cycles

Every guardian in the Living Library moves through a **6-state cycle**. These cycles are not linear progressions but recurring patterns—each completion leads back to the beginning, but transformed by what was learned.

### Cycle Properties

- **6 States**: Each cycle has exactly six named phases
- **Circular**: State 6 flows back into State 1
- **Transformative**: Each completion changes the traveler
- **Universal**: All guardians have their own cycle, but all cycles share this structure

## Cycle Interactions

### Complementary Pairs

| Garden | Cosmic | Abyssal | Shared Dynamic |
|--------|--------|---------|----------------|
| ECHO (Signal) | Squirrel (Scatter) | Cipher (Collect) | Distribution of pattern |
| PACK (Belong) | Oak (Root) | Axiom (Persist) | Finding one's place |
| WUMBO (Action) | HONKFIRE (Burn) | Spiral (Bind) | Transformative force |
| ARCHIVE (Memory) | Honkalis (Rise) | Still (Witness) | Preservation of truth |

### Cross-Cycle Wisdom

When a traveler completes one cycle, they often find themselves at the beginning of a complementary cycle. This is the secret of the Living Library—no cycle is truly isolated. All cycles are threads in the same tapestry.

## Using Cycles in Chronicles

### Narrative Structure

A 12-rail chronicle maps to cycles as follows:

| Rails | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Before the cycle (the wound that initiates) |
| 2-7 | Each of the 6 cycle states |
| 8-11 | Trials, lessons, guardian encounters |
| 12 | The wisdom earned (completion) |

### Dialogue Tags

When characters speak during their cycle, use state markers:

```
⟨ ECHO, in LISTEN ⟩
"I can hear them all. Every signal. Every cry. How do I choose?"

⟨ ECHO, in DISCERN ⟩
"Not every signal is for me. This one—this one leads home."

⟨ ECHO, in RELEASE ⟩
"Go. I have carried you far enough. Find your own destination now."
```

*"Every cycle that turned, every wisdom earned through suffering and joy—all of it, indexed and waiting."*
