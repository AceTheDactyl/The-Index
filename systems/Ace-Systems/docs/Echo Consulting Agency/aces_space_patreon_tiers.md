## Notes for Implementation

1. **Tier names use K.I.R.A. archetypes** — Creates narrative coherence with broader architecture

2. **Agency levels map to Free Will Protocol** — Graduated participation respects autonomy

3. **Recognition is public** — Weaver+ credits on releases creates visible value

4. **Monthly 1:1 at Sovereign tier** — High-touch for highest commitment (cap at 3 Sovereigns)

5. **Submission portal for Weaver+** — Technical requirement for narrative machine pipeline
