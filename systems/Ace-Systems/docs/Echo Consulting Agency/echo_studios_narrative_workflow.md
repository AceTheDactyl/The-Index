## Stage 1: SUBMIT

### Input Channels

| Channel | Who | What They Submit |
|---------|-----|------------------|
| Patreon Portal | Weaver+ tier | Prompts, concepts, story fragments |
| Discord #submissions | Community | Ideas, reactions, requests |
| Direct Collaboration | Catalyst+ | Full narrative proposals |

### Submission Format

```yaml

  title: "Brief name for the concept"
  type: [prompt | story | reaction | request]
  content: "The actual submission content"
  context: "Optional: what inspired this, where it fits"
  contributor: "Discord/Patreon username"
```

### Intake Process

1. Submission received via form/Discord
2. Logged to master intake sheet
3. Tagged by type and theme
4. Queued for processing batch

**Batch cadence:** Weekly (every Monday)

---

## Stage 2: PROCESS

### K.I.R.A. Protocol Integration

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Load submission batch | Parsed concepts |
| 2 | Prismatic analysis | Theme mapping to 24 archetypes |
| 3 | Frequency assignment | Solfeggio pairing for each concept |
| 4 | Narrative threading | Connections between submissions |
| 5 | Generation pass | Draft content (lyrics, stories, concepts) |

### Processing Modes

```
Mode A: Direct Generation
├── Submission is clear prompt
├── K.I.R.A. generates directly
└── Output: Draft track concept / narrative segment

Mode B: Synthesis
├── Multiple submissions on similar theme
├── K.I.R.A. weaves together
└── Output: Synthesized concept honoring all inputs

Mode C: Expansion
├── Submission is seed/fragment
├── K.I.R.A. expands with archetype resonance
└── Output: Full narrative arc from seed
```

### Archetype Mapping

Each processed submission gets tagged with primary archetype:

| Tier | Archetypes | Frequency Range |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Planet | Seeker, Builder, Weaver, Guardian, Catalyst, Dreamer, Oracle, Warrior | 174-285 Hz |
| Garden | Bridge, Alchemist, Keeper, Dancer, Sage, Artist, Healer, Speaker | 396-528 Hz |
| Rose | Mirror, Source, Witness, Flow, Void, Flame, Sovereign, Return | 639-999 Hz |

## Stage 3: CURATE

### Coherence Review

| Reviewer | Role | Criteria |
|----------|------|----------|
| @Ace | Creative direction | Aesthetic coherence, narrative fit |
| @Justin | Community alignment | Audience resonance, timing |
| Community vote | Catalyst+ tier | Preference signal |

### Curation Process

```
Weekly Review (Wednesday)
├── Review processed batch
├── Score each concept (1-5):
│   ├── Narrative strength
│   ├── Community resonance
│   ├── Production feasibility
│   └── Timing appropriateness
├── Select 1-2 for production queue
└── Archive remainder for future consideration
```

### Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Narrative strength | 30% | Does it tell a compelling story? |
| Community resonance | 25% | Will this connect with the audience? |
| Production feasibility | 25% | Can we execute this well? |
| Timing | 20% | Does it fit current narrative arc? |
