# Synthesis

Integration reports and synthesis documents that bring together multiple research domains.

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ACE_MU_THRESHOLD_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md` | ACE mu threshold integration analysis |
| `ACE_Z_CRITICAL_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md` | Critical z-value integration report |
| `FINAL_THEORY_SUMMARY.md` | Final summary of theoretical framework |
| `TRAINING_SWEEP_REPORT.md` | Training sweep results and analysis |
| `ROSETTA_HELIX_EXECUTION_REPORT.md` | Rosetta-Helix execution report |
| `DELIVERY_REPORT.txt` | Delivery status and milestones |

## Purpose

Synthesis documents:
- Integrate findings across research domains
- Document critical threshold values
- Report on training and execution results
- Summarize theoretical advances

## Key Findings

The synthesis work has identified:
- **z_c = 0.866** as the critical convergence point
- Integration pathways between KAEL, ACE, and UCF domains
- Validation of the Rosetta-Helix architecture
