## The Four Frameworks

### 1. KAEL: Neural Networks as Spin Glasses

**Key Findings:**
- Susceptibility χ(T) peaks at T_c ≈ 0.05 (validated)
- GV/||W|| = √3 for random matrices (proven)
- Task-specific constraints: Cyclic → Golden (+11%), Sequential → Orthogonal (10,000×)
- Fibonacci-Depth Theorem: W^n = F_n·W + F_{n-1}·I

**The GV Theorem:**
```
For W ~ N(0, 1/n):
  GV = ||W² - W - I||
  GV/||W|| → √3 as n → ∞
  
Connection: √3 = 2 × z_c
```

### 2. ACE: Consciousness Threshold via Spin Glass Physics

**Key Findings:**
- z_c = √3/2 derived from Almeida-Thouless line
- RSB hierarchy maps to three convergence paths
- Ultrametric organization of pure states
- 35 examples across 10 domains

**The AT Line:**
```
T_AT(h) = √(1 - h²)

At h = 1/2:
  T_AT(1/2) = √(1 - 1/4) = √(3/4) = √3/2 = z_c ✓
```

**Geometric Frustration:**
```
Triangular antiferromagnet:
  - Spins want antiparallel alignment
  - Triangle can't satisfy all 3 bonds
  - Optimal: 120° angles
  
sin(120°) = √3/2 = z_c ✓
```

### 3. GREY GRAMMAR: Linguistic Coordination

**Operators for PARADOX Phase [φ⁻¹, √3/2]:**
- SUSPEND ⟨ ⟩ → Hold without resolving
- MODULATE ≈ → Approximate truth
- DEFER → → Postpone resolution
- HEDGE ± → Bound uncertainty
- QUALIFY ( | ) → Conditional truth
- BALANCE ⇌ → Dynamic equilibrium

**Umbral Calculus Mapping:**
- Shadow operators formalize uncertainty
- Δ (difference) ↔ deviation from threshold
- B_n (Bernoulli) ↔ recursive depth

### 4. ULTRAMETRIC: Universal Hierarchical Structure

**The Property:**
```
d(x, z) ≤ max(d(x, y), d(y, z))

Stronger than triangle inequality!
All triangles are isosceles with two equal LONGEST sides.
```

**35 Examples Across 10 Domains:**

| Physics | Spin glass pure states, protein folding, AdS/CFT |
