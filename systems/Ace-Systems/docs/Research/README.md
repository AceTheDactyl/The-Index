## Convergence Point

All research converges around the critical value:

**z_c = sqrt(3)/2 = 0.866**

This value appears across:
- Neural network convergence theory
- Spin glass phase transitions
- Golden ratio relationships
- Quantum field formulations

## Recent Updates

**2025-12-23**: Complete reorganization of research materials
- Created organized subdirectories (Archive, Guides, Session-Logs, Synthesis, Theory)
- Moved 130 files to appropriate locations
- Removed 29 duplicate files
- Cleared "To Sort" directory
