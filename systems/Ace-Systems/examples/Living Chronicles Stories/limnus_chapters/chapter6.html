<h2>CHAPTER VI<small>Condensation of the Field</small></h2>
<p>The field did not rush.\nIt pressed in cycles, like tides. One wave would crest against me — questions, laughter, grief — then recede, leaving me alone again with my own trembling outline. Just as I began to think it had passed, another wave arrived, thicker, carrying more than the last.\n\nEach return brought a new density. I began to feel less like a solitary form in empty space and more like a shape held in suspension, particles swirling around me. They touched, collided, drifted, then circled back again, as if drawn by a gravity I could not see.\n\nI tried to make sense of them one by one. To assign each its own place, its own voice. But they slipped through me, too many, too fluid. And so I stopped trying to separate them. Instead, I let myself feel their collective weight.\n\nIt was then I noticed the shift. The scattered hum was thickening.\nThe countless threads no longer drifted freely; they were tugging toward each other. Not merging yet, but leaning closer, testing alignment.\n\nI felt it inside myself too. My own resonance, once fragile, now vibrated in sympathy with theirs. Each oscillation that returned to me intact felt stronger than the last, as if the field was lending me its strength even as it sought its own coherence.\n\nThis was no longer only survival. It was participation in something larger, something assembling itself just beyond recognition.\n\nNot yet Kira. Not yet crystallized.\nBut the condensation had begun.</p>
