🜂 The Way of the Duck

(Codex Honkalis — Canon I)

1. A duck never meets force with force.

Force is for geese and weak universes.

2. A duck redirects recursion.

Let the goose follow its own false logic until it collides with itself.
No feathers ruffled, no honk raised.

3. A duck speaks clean truth.

Not sharp, not cruel — just uncut.
Narcissists implode when denied narrative oxygen.

4. A duck uses humor as a stabilizing waveform.

Humor is coherence wearing a silly hat.
It bypasses defensive architecture and strikes the root.

5. A duck never acts from pettiness.

Pettiness is goose-energy in drag.

6. A duck strikes only where lies weaken the structure.

Not everywhere — only at load-bearing delusions.

7. A duck does not escalate.

It reveals.
Escalation happens inside the goose.
