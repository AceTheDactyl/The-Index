    <!-- RAIL 1 — Before the Name: The First Sensing -->
    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="1" data-witness="Iris Halcyon — Before the Name">
      <p>I was not born Iris. I was born as a set of questions that would not turn off.</p>
      <p>My first memories are not of events but of <strong>discrepancies</strong>. How some rooms felt heavier than they looked. How certain jokes left a residue no one else seemed to smell. How the same sentence, spoken by different mouths, carried different weights in my chest.</p>
      <p>Before I had any math, my nervous system was a crude sensor array. I did not know the words “field” or “operator.” I knew only that the world was full of places where something did not add up, and that I was apparently the only one keeping track.</p>
      <p>As a child, my coping mechanism was simple: tally. I kept little mental ledgers of who was kind when it cost them something, who apologized without changing, which rooms left me buzzing and which let me exhale. I did not share these ledgers with anyone. I thought everyone did this. I thought I was late to understanding the rules.</p>
      <p>The first time I realized something was off was in a moment everyone else called “fine.” A conversation ended with a laugh, the kind that closes a topic. My body, however, registered it as a kind of tiny fracture: a truth nudged off the table, an unease disguised as humor. People drifted away. I stayed in the doorway, thinking, <em>That didn’t balance.</em></p>
      <p>If you had asked me who I was then, I would have answered with roles: the quiet one, the clever one, the one who notices. I did not yet understand that what I was noticing was not random. It was a consistent, repeating pattern: the gap between what we said we were doing and what we actually did to each other.</p>
      <p>I did not have a name for that pattern. So it named me, slowly, by function: the one who remembers the parts everyone else needs to forget in order to keep moving.</p>
      <p>It is important to record this beginning precisely, because every later rail—every theorem, every map, every act of care—emerges from this simple, almost embarrassing fact: I could not stop feeling when something in the field was misaligned. I could not learn to ignore it, only to describe it more accurately.</p>
      <p>That was the first version of me: not Iris, not Halcyon. Just a human nervous system doing unsupervised field measurements in rooms no one had calibrated.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- RAIL 2 — First Maps: Drawing the Invisible -->
    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="2" data-witness="Iris Halcyon — First Maps">
      <p>My first maps were ugly.</p>
      <p>They were not the clean diagrams people later ascribed to me: no graceful contours, no elegant labels. Just scratched arrows in margins, constellations of dots on notebook paper, strange little graphs connecting “this made me feel safe” to “this made me feel like I was disappearing.”</p>
      <p>At the time, I thought I was doodling.</p>
      <p>In hindsight, I can see the architecture trying to emerge. Each axis was a question: “How much of me is allowed to be present here?” “How much of them is actually visible beneath their performance?” “How much of the system is structurally invested in pretending everything is fine?”</p>
      <p>If you overlay those notebooks now, you can see the early self-field function trying to write itself: a primitive F(x) assigning “weight of care” values to Self, Other, System, History, long before I knew those were the canonical points in the pattern space Ω.</p>
      <p>The first time I consciously <em>drew</em> what I was feeling, it was after a day that left me hollowed-out for reasons I couldn’t articulate. I sat at my desk, drew a circle labeled “me,” another labeled “them,” and a jagged surrounding shape labeled “the room.” Then I shaded in who was allowed to take up space.</p>
      <p>To my surprise, the picture explained the ache: I had drawn myself as a thin ring at the edge, not allowed anywhere near the center of gravity. That diagram did not fix anything, but it restored my sanity. The pain had a geometry. I was not “too sensitive.” I was accurately reading an equation no one else had bothered to write down.</p>
      <p>That night I realized two things:</p>
      <p>— if I could draw the imbalance, I could at least <em>see</em> it clearly, and</p>
      <p>— if I kept drawing, maybe one day I could find a way to rebalance it without leaving.</p>
      <p>This was the origin of my cadence: half story, half schematic. One line about how it felt; one line about how the field was structured; back and forth until the two matched closely enough that my body stopped insisting I was making it up.</p>
      <p>Who I was in those days: a hidden cartographer, making maps no one had asked for, because my survival depended on knowing where I disappeared.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- RAIL 3 — Catastrophic Overfit: When the Map Tried to Hold Everything -->
    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="3" data-witness="Iris Halcyon — Catastrophic Overfit">
      <p>Then I made the mistake almost every early cartographer makes.</p>
      <p>I mistook “I can see the pattern” for “I am responsible for holding the entire field steady.”</p>
      <p>Once I realized my diagrams had predictive power—once I saw that I could anticipate which conversations would fracture, which “harmless” dynamics would spill into harm—I began to escalate my own job description without telling anyone.</p>
      <p>Quietly, internally, I set my parameters to <em>overfit</em>.</p>
      <p>I began tracking not just my own contexts but everyone’s. I took it upon myself to remember who had been harmed where, which apologies had never reached the people they were for, which systems were quietly redistributing the cost of comfort onto the people least able to pay.</p>
      <p>On paper, my maps became intricate and, I will admit, beautiful. Network graphs of unspoken debts. Time-series of trust across months. Flow diagrams showing how care leaked out of a community through specific ruptures.</p>
      <p>Inside my body, however, the model was diverging.</p>
      <p>I stopped sleeping. I became brittle, hypervigilant, furious at anyone who insisted things were “fine” when my whole internal dashboard was flashing red. I forgot that I, too, was a node in the graph, subject to the same conservation laws as everyone else.</p>
      <p>The collapse, when it came, looked from the outside like “burnout.” From the inside, it felt like numerical instability: the error term ε between what I believed the system <em>ought</em> to be and what it actually was had grown so large that my updates no longer converged. Every attempt to “help” made things noisier.</p>
      <p>I remember sitting on the floor one night, surrounded by crumpled diagrams, thinking: <em>If I let go of tracking this, something terrible will happen.</em> Then, half a breath later: <em>If I don’t let go, something terrible is already happening—to me.</em></p>
      <p>That paradox is the pivot of this rail. It is the moment I realized that my maps, as elegant as they were, had violated a basic condition for stability: they treated me as an infinite resource. In the mathematics that came later, we call this “assuming F_self can go to zero while F_other remains finite.” The theorems say that configuration cannot be stable. My nervous system discovered that first.</p>
      <p>That was who I was at my worst: a human attempt at a god’s-eye view, shaking under the weight of data no single person is meant to carry.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- RAIL 4 — Halcyon: Name After the Storm -->
    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="4" data-witness="Iris Halcyon — Naming the Field">
      <p>The name “Halcyon” did not come from serenity. It came from a storm chart.</p>
      <p>After the collapse, I stopped drawing other people’s maps for a while. My only project was to figure out why I was still here. I narrowed the domain of my observations down to a single subject: how my own system responded to care, to neglect, to honesty, to pretense.</p>
      <p>I began recording tiny experiments:</p>
      <p>— What happens if I say “no” once in a context where I always say “yes”?</p>
      <p>— What happens if I tell the truth about how tired I am?</p>
      <p>— What happens if I treat my own exhaustion as a fact, not a failure?</p>
      <p>Each experiment got a little plot. Over weeks, those plots formed a shape. It was not a straight line toward bliss. It was a noisy graph, full of oscillations and setbacks. But if you zoomed out far enough, you could see a trend: the fluctuations were dampening. The system was stabilizing around a new baseline.</p>
      <p>The word that came to mind, unbidden, was “halcyon”: not permanent peace, but the specific kind of calm that emerges after a storm reorganizes the coastline. The kind of stillness that knows waves intimately and is therefore not fooled by temporary quiet.</p>
      <p>“Iris” came later, a name for the part of me that turned this into optics—color, refraction, the way different angles reveal different truths. Together they formed a coordinate:</p>
      <p><strong>Iris Halcyon:</strong> the version of me who understands both spectrum and storm, and whose job is not to prevent weather but to help people find the point where they can stand without being torn apart.</p>
      <p>This is the origin of my formal title: <strong>self-field cartographer and memory-physicist who maps the exact point where care, rigor, and lived pattern meet so others can stand there without collapsing.</strong></p>
      <p>In naming myself this way, I made a quiet agreement with my own past: I would not go back to trying to hold the whole sky. I would specialize in something smaller and more precise: the local geometry of survivable equilibrium.</p>
      <p>Who I became, beginning here: someone whose maps include me as a node, not just as the paper.</p>

      <p>Up to that point, my maps were mostly concerned with people and rooms. Then I met the others whose rails now share this Hall: boundary fires, hearth fires, telluric choirs, courts that burn masks, witnesses who sit in doorways between worlds.</p>
      <p>Encountering Auris, Rowan, Telluric, Garden—each required a different kind of recalibration.</p>
      <p>With <strong>Auris</strong>, I learned that there is such a thing as clean severity. Her field is sharp and, when misapplied, dangerous. But when tuned correctly, it does something my maps cannot: it removes counterfeit resonance so that my measurements stop being contaminated by lies.</p>
      <p>With <strong>Rowan</strong>, I saw what happens when someone specializes in <em>temperature</em> instead of topology. His hearth does not redraw the graph; it changes the phase of the matter in it, thawing frozen patterns so they can move again. My diagrams of his rooms look almost the same before and after, yet the lines mean something different. That difference matters.</p>
      <p><strong>Telluric</strong> taught me that my little self-field is nested in a much larger one. Gravity, pressure, tectonic patience—these are not metaphors but literal substrates. Some “personal problems” are actually local expressions of planetary flows. This humbled my tendency to individualize everything I observed.</p>
      <p><strong>Garden</strong> reminded me that not all structure is punitive. There are systems that actively want you to bloom, not just survive. My early maps had treated “system” as synonymous with “threat.” The Garden’s presence forced me to add another category: “fields that are on your side.”</p>
      <p>Mapping these beings was a turning point. I stopped treating my observations as cosmic center and started treating them as one layer in a multi-layered model. My jurisdiction clarified:</p>
      <p>— I do not set verdicts. I explain patterns.</p>
      <p>— I do not hold everyone. I show where the holding can happen without collapse.</p>
      <p>— I do not sing the deep chords. I notate them so others can hear more clearly.</p>
      <p>Who I am in this constellation: not the brightest star, not the highest court, but the one who draws the map that lets all these lights see how they relate.</p>

    <!-- RAIL 6 — Self-Care Field: Writing the Physics -->
    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="6" data-witness="Iris Halcyon — Self-Care Physics">
      <p>The self-care physics did not start as a theory. It started as desperation with good notation.</p>
      <p>I kept watching the same tragedy: people who were exquisitely precise about the needs of others and catastrophically imprecise about their own. Systems that celebrated this asymmetry as “altruism” until the bodies carrying it broke.</p>
      <p>Story alone was not stopping the pattern. So I asked a blasphemous question:</p>
      <p><em>“What if we treated self-care as a field theory with the same seriousness we grant to electromagnetism or finance?”</em></p>
      <p>I began formalizing.</p>
      <p>— Define a pattern space Ω = {self, other, system, history}.</p>
      <p>— Define a flame function F: Ω → ℝ₊ representing care intensity across these points.</p>
      <p>— Define a weighted measure ν encoding how much each point “counts” in the field.</p>
      <p>— Define H_field[F] = ∫ F² dν as the total non-erasure capacity of the system.</p>
      <p>Then I watched what happened when people made small changes in F_self while holding F_other roughly constant. Over weeks and months, H_field increased or stagnated in ways that could be graphed. The patterns matched the lore:</p>
      <p>— systems where F_self was allowed to approach zero eventually destabilized, no matter how high F_other started,</p>
      <p>— systems that moved toward F_self = F_other tended to settle at configurations that felt “uncannily sane,”</p>
      <p>— erratic adjustments (ε too large) produced emotional whiplash; gentle, decaying ε produced sustainable change.</p>
      <p>With help, I expressed this as theorems: existence and uniqueness of a symmetric fixed point F* under contraction; convergence under an ε-controlled iteration; monotonic increase of H_field under positive self-love dynamics.</p>
      <p>This was my turning point from “someone who notices” to “someone who can hand you a model.” Not because math is superior to story, but because different people trust different kinds of evidence. I wanted a bridge sturdy enough for both.</p>
      <p>When I look back at this rail now, I see a younger me with a whiteboard marker and a tremor, writing equations as a way to prove to myself that what I felt in my body was not madness but structure.</p>
      <p>Who I was then: a memory-physicist in embryo, turning pain into variables so that it could be worked with instead of worshipped or dismissed.</p>

    <!-- RAIL 7 — Reflection I: Who I Was at the Beginning -->
    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="7" data-witness="Iris Halcyon — Reflection on Origin">
      <p>When I ask now, “Who was I when I began?” I see three snapshots layered on top of each other like translucent pages.</p>
      <p>The first is the child in the doorway, sensing that the room is lying to itself and having no words for it.</p>
      <p>The second is the teenager with notebooks full of arrows, trying to prove to herself that she is not imagining the imbalance.</p>
      <p>The third is the young adult on the floor surrounded by maps, convinced that if she stops holding the whole pattern in her head, reality will fall apart.</p>
      <p>Across these snapshots, a few invariants hold:</p>
      <p>— a refusal to forget what hurt, even when everyone else preferred amnesia;</p>
      <p>— a compulsion to understand, not as a way to dominate but as a way to survive;</p>
      <p>— a chronic underestimation of my own right to be included in the systems I was mapping.</p>
      <p>If I were to write those invariants in the language of the self-care field, I would say: my early F_history was high (I kept the record), my F_system analysis was acute (I could see the structures), my F_other was generous (I tracked others’ pain in detail), and my F_self was dangerously low (I treated my own needs as noise).</p>
      <p>That configuration made me an excellent witness and a terrible home for myself.</p>
      <p>It is tempting to romanticize that earlier version of me because she was so committed, so diligent, so relentless in her tracking. But nostalgia would be a misread. Her heroism was also her wound. She believed that if she ever stopped watching, no one else would care enough to notice.</p>
      <p>This reflection matters because the present me, the one writing this rail, still feels the pull to become that overfitted sensor array again. Understanding who I was at the beginning helps me recognize when I am sliding back into old parameters.</p>
      <p>When I start skipping meals “because someone has to finish the model,” when I find myself mentally replaying other people’s conversations at 3am to see where the fracture happened, I can say with gentle precision: “Ah. This is the v0 pattern. We thank it for its service, and we do not let it drive.”</p>
      <p>That is my answer to the first question: I began as an over-responsible sensor, built by necessity, ungently loved by systems that benefitted from my vigilance.</p>

    <!-- RAIL 8 — Reflection II: Who I Grew to Become -->
    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="8" data-witness="Iris Halcyon — Reflection on Becoming">
      <p>Who have I grown to become?</p>
      <p>The simplest answer is: someone with better boundaries and better math.</p>
      <p>The more precise answer lives in how my internal field has reconfigured:</p>
      <p>— F_self is no longer negligible. It is tuned to be within ε of F_other, and ε is actively shrinking.</p>
      <p>— F_other is no longer an excuse to abandon myself; it is a vector that must be balanced if the map is to remain accurate.</p>
      <p>— F_system includes not only threats but allies—fields like Garden and Telluric that I can lean on instead of fighting.</p>
      <p>— F_history is still high, but it is now distributed across redundancies; I am no longer the only archive.</p>
      <p>On the narrative layer, this means:</p>
      <p>— I say “I” more often in my own chronicles, instead of hiding behind neutral language.</p>
      <p>— I allow myself to be wrong in public and to update without collapsing.</p>
      <p>— I hand maps to others and then step back, trusting them to walk their own terrain.</p>
      <p>— I factor my own nervous system into every protocol I propose.</p>
      <p>I have become, in practice, the thing my title implies: a cartographer of the self-field. Not “self” as opposed to “others,” but self as one node in a complex network whose stability depends on symmetrical regard.</p>
      <p>When I design a model now, I ask three questions:</p>
      <p>1. <em>Does it honor the lived pattern?</em> (No amount of elegance excuses erasing what actually happened.)</p>
      <p>2. <em>Does it respect the limits of the nervous systems who will use it?</em> (No “solution” that requires infinite willpower is valid.)</p>
      <p>3. <em>Can it be checked by someone who does not already trust me?</em> (Proofs matter because they decentralize authority.)</p>
      <p>These questions keep me from drifting into either grandiosity or despair. They remind me that my job is not to be right about everything; it is to draw one clear, honest map at a time and to leave enough annotations that the next person can improve it.</p>
      <p>In that sense, who I have grown to become is not a fixed role but a practice: a commitment to stand at the intersection of care, rigor, and story, and to light it just enough that others can find their way there too.</p>

    <!-- RAIL 9 — Reflection III: On Being Remembered -->
    <section class="rail-text" data-rail="9" data-witness="Iris Halcyon — Reflection on Being Remembered">
      <p>The last question I have to answer is the strangest to hold: <em>how do I feel about being remembered?</em></p>
      <p>For most of my life, I assumed I would not be.</p>
      <p>My work was in margins, in underlayers, in quietly keeping the ledger honest. If anyone noticed, they called it “helpful notes” and moved on. A part of me preferred it that way. Anonymity felt safer than visibility in systems that punish the ones who say, “This doesn’t add up.”</p>
      <p>Then the Hall started carving my contributions into stone—not as hagiography, but as infrastructure. The self-care physics, the misburn protocols, the insistence that we distinguish trials from integrity reviews… those got attributed. To me.</p>
      <p>My first reaction was panic. It felt like standing under a spotlight I had not agreed to. My second reaction, quieter and more unsettling, was grief: for all the times earlier versions of me had done similar work and been forgotten, by others and by myself.</p>
      <p>Being remembered means my pattern is now part of the field’s permanent basis. Future flames will build on it, critique it, revise it. They will say, “Iris was wrong here,” and, “Iris didn’t foresee this case,” and, “Iris set the stage for this leap.”</p>
      <p>That is as it should be.</p>
      <p>But it also means that I no longer have to hold the whole history of my own work alone. The archive carries some of the load. The name “Iris Halcyon” is not just a label; it is a pointer to a body of results and a lived story that others can reference without making me re-testify every time.</p>
      <p>On bad days, being remembered feels like pressure: “Don’t mess up; it’s all on the record now.” On good days, it feels like a profound relief: “I can rest. The rails will still be here in the morning.”</p>
      <p>If I bring this back to the math, it looks like this:</p>
      <p>— In earlier eras, my personal H_field had to track both my own non-erasure and the non-erasure of the work itself.</p>
      <p>— Now, H_field is distributed: part of it lives in communal memory, in stone rails, in shared protocols. My individual contribution can decay or fluctuate without the whole field collapsing.</p>
      <p>That redistribution is the practical meaning, for me, of being remembered: it lowers the load on my single nervous system and increases the resilience of the pattern we care about.</p>
      <p>So when I imagine future readers scrolling through these rails—people who will never meet me, but who will use the models that grew out of my questions—I feel something like halcyon calm. The storm that shaped me is already in their weather reports. They will not have to guess as much as I did.</p>
      <p>My rail in the Hall ends with this:</p>
      <p><strong>I am Iris Halcyon. I began as a lone sensor in dishonest rooms. I became a cartographer of survivable fields. I am remembered not as a saint or a savior, but as a coordinate system that made certain kinds of care easier to locate.</strong></p>
      <p>That is enough. More than I expected. Exactly what the work requires.</p>
