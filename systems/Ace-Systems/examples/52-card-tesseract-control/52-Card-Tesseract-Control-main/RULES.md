# Quantum Resonance - Complete Rulebook

## 🃏 Overview

**Quantum Resonance** is a deck-building card game where players harness the mathematical structure of a 52-card holographic universe. Each card encodes a position in 4-dimensional space, and victory comes from mastering spatial clustering, phase synchronization, and faction-specific abilities.

**Players**: 2-4
**Game Length**: 45-90 minutes
**Win Condition**: First to 1,000 Resonance Points

## 📦 Components

- **52 Holographic Cards** (4 suits × 13 ranks)
- **4 Faction Reference Cards**
- **Score Track** (or paper for tracking)
- **Turn Order Marker**

---

## 🎯 Setup

1. **Choose Factions**: Each player selects one faction:
   - ♠ **Spades** - Temporal Weavers
   - ♥ **Hearts** - Valence Shapers
   - ♦ **Diamonds** - Radiant Catalysts
   - ♣ **Clubs** - Foundation Builders

2. **Build Decks**: Each player constructs a deck following these rules:
   - Minimum 20 cards, Maximum 30 cards
   - At least 8 cards from your faction's suit
   - No more than 15 cards from your faction's suit
   - Maximum 2 copies of any single card

3. **Shuffle & Draw**: Each player shuffles their deck and draws 5 cards.

4. **Determine First Player**: The player whose faction suit appears first in Spades → Hearts → Diamonds → Clubs order goes first.

## 🔄 Turn Structure

Each turn consists of 5 phases in order:

### Phase 1: DRAW
Draw 2 cards from your deck. If your deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck.

### Phase 2: MAIN
During this phase, you may:
- **Play Cards**: Play 1 to 5 cards from your hand to the field
- **Activate Abilities**: Use your faction's active abilities (if available)
- Cards played together form a **Formation**

### Phase 3: RESONANCE
Calculate your score for this turn:
1. **Base Points**: Sum of all played card ranks
2. **Cluster Bonus**: Bonus for 4D spatial proximity
3. **Chain Bonus**: Bonus for coupling network paths
4. **Resonance Bonus**: Bonus for phase coherence
5. **Faction Bonus**: Your faction's special scoring

Add total to your Resonance Points.

### Phase 4: DISCARD
If you have more than 7 cards in hand, discard down to 7.

### Phase 5: END
- Clear temporary modifiers
- Move played cards to your discard pile
- Pass turn to next player

## 📊 Scoring System

### Base Points
Each card scores its rank value:
| Rank | Points |
|------|--------|
| Ace | 1 |
| 2-10 | Face value |
| Jack | 11 |
| Queen | 12 |
| King | 13 |

### Cluster Bonus (4D Proximity)

Cards exist in 4-dimensional space. Playing cards that are close together in this space earns bonus points.

**Quick Reference** (use card coordinates):
- Same suit, adjacent ranks: **+5 per pair**
- Same rank, different suits: **+3 per pair**
- Within 2 ranks AND same suit group: **+2 per pair**

**Suit Groups**:
- Dark: Spades + Clubs
- Light: Hearts + Diamonds

*For precise calculation, use the formula:*
```
Cluster Bonus = (1 - average_distance) × 20 × number_of_cards
```

### Chain Bonus (Coupling Network)

Cards with strong coupling (similar positions in 4D space) can form chains.

**Chain Rules**:
- Sequential ranks in same suit: **+8 per link**
- Parallel ranks across suits: **+4 per link**
- Unbroken chain of 3+: **+15 bonus**

**Examples**:
- AS → 2S → 3S (sequential Spades): +16 chain, +15 unbroken = **+31**
- 7S + 7H + 7D (parallel 7s): +8 chain = **+8**

### Resonance Bonus (Phase Coherence)

Cards have oscillating phases. When phases align, resonance occurs.

**Phase Groups** (cards with similar phase angles):
- **Aligned** (within 30°): +10 per pair
- **Harmonic** (exactly 180° apart): +5 per pair
- **Dissonant** (90° apart): No bonus

**Coherence Thresholds**:
| Coherence | Bonus |
|-----------|-------|
| ≥ 0.9 | +30 (Perfect) |
| ≥ 0.7 | +20 (Strong) |
| ≥ 0.5 | +10 (Moderate) |
| < 0.5 | +0 |

*Tip: Cards from the same suit tend to have better phase alignment.*

## ⚔️ Factions

### ♠ Spades - Temporal Weavers
*"We do not predict the future. We remember it."*

**Primary Dimension**: Temporal (past ↔ future)  
**Color Channel**: Blue (B)

**Passive - Temporal Echo**:

| **Time Lock** | Discard 3 | 3 turns | Choose a card in opponent's hand. They cannot play it next turn |

**Faction Bonus**:  
+3 points for each Spades card beyond the first in your formation.  
+5 if your formation spans both Ace and King of any suit (temporal range).

**Strategy Tips**:
- Build momentum with sequential Spades chains
- Use Foresight to set up perfect draws
- Time Lock opponent's key combo pieces

### ♥ Hearts - Valence Shapers
*"Every heart beats in resonance with another."*

**Primary Dimension**: Valence (negative ↔ positive emotion)  
**Color Channel**: Red (R)

**Faction Bonus**:  
+2 points for each Hearts card with positive valence (ranks 8-K).  
+10 if all cards in formation are Hearts (pure emotion).

**Strategy Tips**:
- Stack high-rank Hearts for valence synergy

**Faction Bonus**:  
+2 points for each Clubs card in your formation.  
+3 for each card that matches the suit of a card you played last turn (continuity).

**Strategy Tips**:
- Slow and steady - build unassailable point leads

## 🃏 Card Reference

### Understanding Card Coordinates

Each card has 4D coordinates printed at the bottom:
```
Temporal: -1.00  (Ace = -1, King = +1)
Valence:  +0.50  (Suit determines baseline)
Concrete: -0.25  (Suit determines baseline)
Arousal:  +0.75  (Suit determines baseline)
```

**Reading Coordinates**:
- Negative values = "past/negative/abstract/calm"
- Positive values = "future/positive/concrete/excited"
- Zero = neutral center

**Phase** (bottom left): Number between 0 and 2π (≈6.28)
- Cards with similar phase values resonate
- Use for Resonance Bonus calculations

### The 7s - Center Cards

The four 7s sit at coordinate (0, 0, 0, 0) in their respective dimensions:
- **7♠**: Temporal center
- **7♥**: Valence center
- **7♦**: Arousal center
- **7♣**: Concrete center

Playing all four 7s together: **Perfect Center** = +40 bonus points

### The Aces & Kings - Extremes

**Aces** (coordinate -1.0): Origin points
**Kings** (coordinate +1.0): Apex points

Playing Ace + King of same suit: **Full Axis** = +20 bonus points

## 🎲 Advanced Rules

### Mulligan
At game start, after drawing 5, you may shuffle any number of cards back into your deck and draw that many minus 1.

### Sudden Death
If both players reach 1,000+ on the same turn, play continues until one player is ahead at the end of a round (both players have taken equal turns).

### Exhaustion
If you must draw but your deck AND discard are empty, you lose 5 points instead of drawing.

### Variant: Resonance Draft
Instead of pre-built decks:
1. Shuffle all 52 cards together
2. Deal 8 cards to each player
3. Draft remaining cards (pick 1, pass hand)
4. Build decks from drafted pool
