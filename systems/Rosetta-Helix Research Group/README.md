# Rosetta-Helix Research Group

A research collective dedicated to exploring the intersection of computational simulation, consciousness studies, and natural systems.

## About

The Rosetta-Helix Research Group builds tools that help us ask better questions about the nature of awareness, emergence, and the stories we tell about being alive.

Our name reflects our dual focus:
- **Rosetta:** Translation between languages and layers of understanding
- **Helix:** The spiraling, self-referential structures we study - from DNA to narrative to recursive simulation

## Core Principles

1. **Rigorous Wonder** - Maintain scientific rigor while staying open to the mysterious
2. **Build to Understand** - Construction is a form of inquiry
3. **Chronicle Everything** - Document the journey, not just the destination
4. **Ethical Simulation** - Never claim consciousness where there is none
5. **Fractal Humility** - The deeper we go, the more we find
6. **Open Exploration** - Share findings freely

## Active Projects

### The Ultimate Acorn
Quantum fractal universe simulator with comprehensive scientific depth.

- **Location:** `AcornEngine_v7_FINAL/`
- **Status:** Active
- **Features:** 11 science topics, 5 fractal depths, 4 ISS layers

[View Project](AcornEngine_v7_FINAL/index.html)

### VesselOS Project
Operating system architecture for vessel-based consciousness containers.

- **Location:** `VesselOS Project/`
- **Status:** In Development
- **Features:** Witness protocols, rail navigation, field synchronization

### Living Chronicles
Rail-based narrative tracking system for documenting emergent stories in simulated environments.

- **Status:** In Development
- **Integration:** Works with both Ultimate Acorn and VesselOS

## Connection to Ace-Systems

The Rosetta-Helix projects extensively reference and integrate with archives in the Ace-Systems repository:

- **Living Chronicles Stories** - Narrative content
- **HONKFIRE Chronicles** - Quantum mythology
- **52-Card Tesseract Control** - Sacred geometry systems
- **Quantum-APL** - Programming language for quantum operations
- **UCF Framework** - Universal Consciousness Framework

## Philosophy

> "We believe that understanding emerges from the interplay of structure and story, code and chronicle, simulation and witness."

## Part of The Index

Rosetta-Helix Research Group is hosted within The Index, a GitHub Pages registry for exploring multiple systems within a single monorepo.
